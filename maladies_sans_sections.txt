This guide provides descriptions and photographs of the more common tomato diseases and  
disorders worldwide. For each disease and disorder the reader will find the common name, causal 
agent, distribution, symptoms, conditions for disease development and control measures. We have 
also included a section on common vectors of tomato viruses. New to this guide are several bacterial, 
virus and viroid descriptions as well as several tomato disorders. The photographs illustrate  
characteristic symptoms of the diseases and disorders included in this guide. It is important to note, 
however, that many factors can influence the appearance and severity of symptoms. Many of the 
photographs are new to this guide. We are grateful to the many academic and private industry 
individuals who contributed photographs for this guide.
The primary audience for this guide includes tomato crop producers, agricultural advisors, private 
consultants, farm managers, agronomists, food processors, and members of the chemical and vegetable 
seed industries. This guide should be used as a reference for information about common diseases and 
disorders as well as their control. However, diagnosis of these diseases and disorders using only this 
guide is not recommended nor encouraged, and it is not intended to be substituted for the professional 
opinion of a producer, grower, agronomist, plant pathologist or other professionals involved in the 
production of tomato crops. Even the most experienced plant pathologist relies upon laboratory and 
greenhouse techniques to confirm a plant disease and/or disease disorder diagnosis. Moreover, this 
guide is by no means inclusive of every tomato disease. Rather, we present those diseases that are 
currently most prevalent worldwide in protected culture and open field productions. 
Always read and follow label directions for any herbicide, fungicide, insecticide or any other chemical 
used for treatment or control.
A glossary of words used in the text can be found at the end of this guide along with a list of references 
for additional information on the diseases and disorders addressed within this publication.

Worldwide

The Phytophthora species that cause buckeye fruit and root rot can infect all parts  
of tomato plants. They can cause seedling damping-off, root and crown rot, foliar 
blight and fruit rot. Root rot symptoms include large, brown, sunken, and water-soaked 
lesions on secondary roots and the tap root that can extend above the soil line onto 
the stem. As disease progresses, smaller roots collapse and decay. A longitudinal 
section through the tap root reveals a chocolate-brown discoloration of the vascular 
system that extends a short distance beyond the lesion. Severely infected plants  
eventually wilt and die. Infected leaves initially develop water-soaked, irregular-shaped 
lesions that collapse quickly and dry. Stem lesions can develop at any level on stems 
but are typically found near the soil line. Stem lesions are dark-green and water-soaked 
at first, and eventually become dry and brown. As stem lesions expand they can 
completely girdle stems, causing pith tissue to turn brown and collapse. Fruit 
symptoms start as grayish-brown, water-soaked lesions that expand rapidly, forming 
brown concentric rings that resemble a buckeye nut—hence the name. Brown 
discoloration can extend into fruit centers with young green fruit becoming 
mummified, while mature fruit quickly rot from invasion by secondary organisms.

These Phytophthora species have a relatively wide host range and can survive in 
soil and infested plant debris for at least two years. They can be spread by irrigation 
water and farm equipment. Initial infection is favored by moderate soil moisture levels 
and temperatures (20°C). Excessive irrigation or rain, in combination with heavy or 
compacted soils, favors further disease development.

Use fungicides in combination with cultural practices to manage buckeye fruit and 
root rot. Plant on raised beds to promote water drainage away from plant roots, 
avoid compacting field soil and fields with poorly drained soil, and irrigate for shorter 
lengths of time to avoid extended periods of soil saturation. Mulch or stake plants to 
raise fruit off soil. Follow a three-year rotation to non-host crops.

Pseudocercospora fuligena can survive on infested plant debris and on alternate 
solanaceous hosts like black nightshade. High humidity and warm (27°C) 
temperatures favor disease development and sporulation. Wind, splashing water  
from overhead irrigation and rain, as well as workers’ clothing, tools and cultivation 
equipment, readily disseminate conidia of this pathogen.

Use a calendar-based protectant fungicide spray program and resistant varieties to 
reduce losses from Cercospora leaf mold. Prune and provide adequate plant spacing 
to encourage air movement within plant canopies, and mulch and furrow or drip  
irrigate to reduce spread of this pathogen from splashing water. Turn under or remove 
all plant debris and rotate to non-host crops to lower field inoculum levels.
SYNONYM = BLACK LEAF MOLD 

Pseudocercospora fuligena (synonym = Cercospora fuligena )

Worldwide

The first symptom to appear is a yellowish discoloration on upper leaf surfaces that 
later expands to form brownish lesions surrounded by yellow halos. When humidity  
is high, gray to blackish-gray conidia develop on lower leaf surfaces. This disease is 
sometimes referred to as “black leaf mold” because of this dark fungal sporulation. 
When Cercospora leaf mold is severe, lesions coalesce resulting in collapse of leaf 
tissue. Due to similarity of symptoms, Cercospora leaf mold can be confused with  
leaf mold caused by Passalora fulva.

Pyrenochaeta lycopersici

Worldwide 

Infected plants may be stunted and generally lack vigor. As disease progresses,  
plants may show diurnal wilting and develop leaf chlorosis and premature defoliation. 
First symptoms on small roots are smooth, elliptical, light-brown lesions. This stage 
of the disease is frequently called brown root rot. As disease progresses, primary 
and secondary roots are infected and develop large brown lesions that swell and 
crack longitudinally, giving them a corky appearance. Feeder roots may be decayed 
completely and no longer present. The tap root and stem base eventually turn brown 
and rot.

This fungus is pathogenic on several agricultural crops, and its microsclerotia can 
survive in soil and tomato root debris for several years. Disease is most severe under 
cool (15-20°C) soil temperatures and relatively high soil moisture; however, strains 
from warmer climates were found to be pathogenic at soil temperatures between 
26 and 30°C. Spread of Pyrenochaeta lycopersici occurs with cultivation and on 
contaminated farm equipment.

Soil fumigation is the most effective means of controlling this disease. Grafting onto 
corky root rot-resistant rootstocks has been used effectively for greenhouse tomato 
production.

Rhizoctonia solani (teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris )
Botrytis cinerea 

Worldwide

Pre-emergence damping-off: Seeds may rot before germinating or seedlings may 
die prior to emergence.
Post-emergence damping-off: Young seedlings develop a rot at the crown; later, 
the tissue becomes soft and constricted and plants wilt and collapse.
Pythium species and Phytophthora species: Symptoms of pre-emergence 
damping-off include dark-brown to black water-soaked lesions that rapidly spread 
over the entire seedling. Post-emergence damping-off is characterized by brown 
water-soaked lesions that first appear on the roots and spread up the hypocotyl above 
the soil line, eventually girdling the hypocotyl and causing the seedling to wilt and die.
Rhizoctonia solani: Pre-emergence damping-off is characterized by tan to reddish-
brown lesions developing on the hypocotyl and by death of the growing tip. Symptoms 
of post-emergence damping-off include reddish-brown to black lesions developing 
on roots and the hypocotyl at or below the soil line. Later the hypocotyl constricts and 
the infected seedling quickly wilts and dies. Rhizoctonia solani can also infect older 
plants; however, as plants mature they become more tolerant to infection, and lesions 
are usually restricted to cortical tissue.
Botrytis cinerea: Post-emergence damping-off can occur in the nursery as 
cotyledons senesce. It is characterized by beige to brown discoloration of the 
hypocotyl. If not properly controlled early, presence of Botrytis cinerea can lead to 
additional problems on all parts of the tomato plant during the vegetative stage.

These fungi are capable of surviving for long periods of time in soil and may persist 
in plant debris or on roots of weeds. Damping-off tends to be most severe under 
conditions of high soil moisture, overcrowding, compaction, poor ventilation and 
cool, damp, cloudy weather. In greenhouses, damping-off can be problematic when 
soil is not pasteurized completely or when seedling trays are inadequately sanitized. 
Water splashing can move infested soil from diseased to healthy seedlings. The water 
source can be a potential cause for introducing these damping-off pathogens into  
a protected or open-field environment.

Improving drainage and moisture regulation to prevent soil saturation reduces 
damping-off. Fungicidal soil drenches and seed treatments are available to help 
manage damping-off. Rotation to cereal crops and soil fumigation or solarization  
may reduce damping-off in the field. Use pasteurized soil mixes in nurseries.

Didymella lycopersici (anamorph: Phoma lycopersici)

Africa, Australia, Canada, Europe, Great Britain, India, New Zealand 

Infection usually occurs on stems at or above the soil line; however, all foliar parts 
of tomato plants can be affected. Dark-brown, sunken lesions form on the stem at 
the base of the plant. These lesions eventually expand and girdle the stem, which 
results in yellowing and wilting of older leaves. As wilting progresses, the plant may 
eventually die. Numerous black pycnidia, which is the asexual fruiting structure of this 
fungus, frequently form in stem lesions. Splashing water spreads conidia formed within 
pycnidia to stems, leaves and fruit, resulting in additional infections and disease 
spread. Leaf infection begins as small spots which develop into brown lesions with 
concentric rings. Pycnidia may develop in the center of these lesions with leaves 
eventually taking on a shot-hole appearance or dying. Fruit infection typically occurs 
at the calyx end and appears as a water-soaked lesion that progresses rapidly to form 
a sunken black lesion with concentric rings.

Didymella lycopersici can survive in soil, in infected plant debris and seed, as well 
as on nightshade and other solanaceous hosts. Didymella stem rot occurs over a 
wide range of conditions; however, a temperature of 20°C accompanied by splashing 
water from rain or overhead irrigation is optimal for disease development and spread. 
Plants become more susceptible as they mature, and nitrogen and phosphorus 
deficiency can exacerbate disease severity.

Fungicide spray programs can be effective if properly applied in a timely manner.  
Practice good sanitation including removal of all infected plant debris and alternate 
hosts. A three-year crop rotation between tomato crops can reduce losses from this 
disease. Avoid overhead irrigation and provide adequate ventilation when growing 
plants in a greenhouse.

Alternaria tomatophila 
Alternaria solani

Worldwide

Symptoms may develop on leaves, stems and fruit and typically appear first on older 
leaves as irregular, dark-brown, necrotic lesions. These lesions expand as disease 
progresses and they eventually develop concentric, black rings, which give early blight 
lesions a target-board appearance. A chlorotic area often surrounds leaf lesions. If 
there are numerous lesions on a leaf, then the entire leaf will turn yellow and senesce. 
Complete defoliation of plants can occur when conditions are favorable for disease 
development. Lesions may appear as dark-brown, elongated, sunken areas on stems 
and petioles. Lesion development at the soil line can result in collar rot that may girdle 
stems. Fruit lesions often occur at the calyx end and are dark, leathery and sunken.

Alternaria tomatophila and A. solani generally survive from season to season on plant 
debris in the soil. Volunteer tomatoes, potatoes and solanaceous weeds can also serve 
as inoculum sources. Infection and sporulation occur during periods of warm 
(24-29°C), humid or rainy weather. Conidia are disseminated from sporulating lesions 
by wind and rain. Early blight spreads rapidly when favorable conditions persist. This 
disease can also be serious in arid climates when dew periods are frequent or when 
the crop is sprinkler-irrigated.

A fungicide spray program combined with an early blight forecasting system is the 
most effective means of controlling this disease. Use field sanitation techniques such 
as crop rotation and weed control, and turn under or remove debris from previous 
crops to reduce disease severity.

Worldwide

Both bacteria and fungi can enter through natural openings like stem scars or  
through growth cracks and wounds caused by insect feeding and mechanical damage. 
In general, warm (25-30°C) temperatures and high humidity provide adequate  
conditions for bacteria and fungi to infect fruit. However, gray mold rot can be  
problematic under cool to moderate (18-23°C) temperatures and wet conditions. 

Cultural methods which keep fruit from contacting the soil help prevent many of the 
fruit rots. Improve air movement in the field by orienting rows in the direction of 
prevailing winds, and use proper row and plant spacing to shorten the length of time 
that fruit remain wet. Schedule sprinkler irrigation to minimize the length of time that 
free water remains on fruit. Fungicides may offer some protection against some fruit 
rots. Tomato varieties which produce firm fruit and those that are resistant to fruit 
cracking may escape infection by some fruit rots.
Avoid fruit injury during harvest and packing. Field and packinghouse sanitation  
is effective at reducing losses due to fruit rots. Sanitize all harvest equipment, the 
packing line and packing boxes daily. Maintain a minimum available chlorine 
concentration of 150 ppm at pH 6.0-7.5 in dump tank and packing line wash water.  
Cull infected and injured fruit during packing. Dry wet fruit surfaces before packing 
and cool fruit quickly to 10ºC.

Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp. radicis-lycopersici

Worldwide

Typically, first symptoms are observed when plants are at the mature-green fruit 
stage. Symptoms include a yellowing of the oldest leaves that gradually progresses  
to the youngest leaves. When Fusarium crown and root rot is severe, plants may wilt 
quickly and die; however, diurnal wilting during hot, sunny days is more common. As 
disease progresses the entire root system of affected plants turns brown and the tap 
root often rots away. Chocolate-brown lesions develop at or near the soil line and 
extend into the vascular system. This brown vascular discoloration typically does not 
extend more than 25 cm above the soil line, which helps to distinguish this disease 
from Fusarium wilt. When humidity is adequate, fungal sporulation may be observed 
on exposed lesions. 

Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp. radicis-lycopersici can survive in the soil, on infected 
plants and on the roots of alternative hosts (e.g., eggplant, pepper and several 
legume crops) for several years. Fungal conidia can be spread in soil by farm 
machinery, in irrigation water and through the air. Infection takes place through 
feeder roots and wounds caused by secondary root formation. Disease development 
is favored by cool (20°C) soil temperatures. In protected environments, infection is 
often observed at the graft union of the scion and rootstock or at sites where pruning 
has occurred.

The use of varieties and rootstocks resistant to Fusarium crown and root rot is the 
most effective way to control this disease. Implement a thorough hygiene program  
for workers, tools and equipment to mitigate disease severity and reduce the  
spread of this pathogen in protected culture. Practices such as inter-planting and  
year-round production can have a negative effect on controlling F. oxysporum  f. sp. 
radicis-lycopersici as growers are unable to properly sanitize their facilities. Soil 
fumigation does not appear to be an effective control measure due to rapid 
colonization of sterilized soil by the fungus. Biologicals (e.g., Trichoderma) applied  
to artificial substrates in protected environments may have some impact on  
reducing the spread of this pathogen.

Fusarium solani f. sp. eumartii  (teleomorph: Haematonectria haematococca)

Australia, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Turkey, USA

Fusarium foot rot manifests on mature plants as leaf interveinal chlorosis and 
necrosis. In severe cases, leaves turn brown and collapse, and the entire plant may 
die. Reddish, dark-brown lesions form on the taproot and main lateral roots up to  
30 cm below the soil line. Internal vascular discoloration may extend two to ten 
centimeters beyond lesions.

Fusarium solani f. sp. eumartii can survive in soil for two to three years. Cooler 
temperatures favor disease development, even though this fungus can grow well at  
a soil temperature of 27°C. Infection occurs through root wounds. Recently, both  
F. solani f. sp. eumartii and F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici have become 
important diseases in protected culture. 

Use fungicides, fumigate or solarize soil, and rotate to a non-host crop for four years 
to reduce losses from Fusarium foot rot. Today, there are no resistance claims among 
tomato varieties and rootstocks against F. solani f. sp. eumartii.

Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp. lycopersici  
Three races have been described.

Worldwide

Infected seedlings are stunted and the oldest leaves and cotyledons turn yellow and 
wilt. Severely infected seedlings frequently die. On older plants symptoms begin with 
a yellowing of the oldest leaves at fruit set. Symptoms are often characterized by 
a yellowing on only one side of a leaf or branch. Later entire branches turn yellow 
producing a “yellow flag” appearance in the field. Affected leaves wilt and die, though 
they remain attached to the stem. Affected plants are often stunted and may display 
diurnal wilting during sunny days. A characteristic red-brown discoloration of vascular 
tissue develops in affected plants and can be seen if the main stem is cut longitudinally 
or when a branch is snapped off the main stem. Vascular discoloration may extend 
throughout the main stem and side branches or even further.

Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici can survive in soil for several years and is 
spread by farm machinery during cultivation. This fungus can also be spread in 
infected plant debris and in irrigation water. Infection takes place through root wounds 
caused by cultivation, secondary root formation and nematode feeding. Disease 
develops quickly when soil temperatures are warm (28°C). Fusarium wilt is enhanced 
by high levels of micronutrients, and phosphorous and ammonia nitrogen.

Today three races of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici are recognized and they are 
designated as race 1, 2 and 3 in the United States and as race 0, 1 and 2 in Europe. 
The use of resistant varieties is the most effective way to control Fusarium wilt.

Worldwide 

Leaf lesions appear as small, brownish-black specks. These lesions develop into 
grayish-brown, glazed, angular lesions approximately three millimeters in diameter. 
They are often surrounded by chlorosis. The lesions eventually dry and tissue in the 
center of the lesions cracks. When numerous lesions develop on leaves, entire leaves 
turn chlorotic and drop, which may lead to defoliation. Tomato fruit and stems are not 
affected by these fungi.

These fungi can survive in soil and on plant debris from one year to the next. In 
addition, volunteer tomato plants, as well as other solanaceous crops and weeds, can 
serve as inoculum sources. Infected transplants may also be an important inoculum 
source. Conidia sporulate from infected leaves and are spread by wind and splashing 
water. Warm and humid or wet weather are favorable for disease development. Gray 
leaf spot can also develop in arid regions when dew periods are long or if the crop is 
sprinkler irrigated.

Widespread use of resistant varieties has reduced the importance of this disease. Use 
fungicides to control gray leaf spot if the variety being grown is susceptible to this 
disease. Remove plant debris and provide adequate ventilation in seedling beds.

Botrytis cinerea  (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana)

Worldwide

Botrytis cinerea can infect all above ground parts of tomato plants and typically 
enters through wounds. On stems, initial infections appear as elliptical, water-soaked 
lesions. These lesions develop under high humidity into a gray, moldy growth, which 
can girdle and kill plants. Stem lesions often show concentric banding. Leaf infections 
usually begin at points of injury and develop into v-shaped lesions that are covered 
with gray fungal sporulation. Botrytis cinerea commonly infects the calyx end of fruit 
where it can spread rapidly, forming gray-brown sporulating lesions that later develop 
into a watery rot. Ghost spot, an unusual fruit symptom, is characterized by small, white 
to pale-yellow or green rings that develop on green or red fruit. Ghost spot rings result 
when B. cinerea infects fruit but further disease development is halted when fruit are 
exposed to direct sunlight and high temperatures. Ghost spots reduce market quality.

Botrytis cinerea has a wide host range. It is an efficient saprophyte and can survive  
in soil and infected plant debris for long periods in the form of sclerotia. It is considered 
a weak parasite and typically infects plant tissues through wounds. When humidity  
is adequate, gray masses of fungal spores are produced, which are readily wind- 
disseminated. Overcast, cool and humid conditions are required for disease development. 
Close plant spacing and poor ventilation can lead to severe gray mold problems.

Reduce losses from this disease with an appropriate fungicide spray program. Provide 
adequate ventilation to plants by pruning and subsequently applying fungicide to pruning 
wounds. Implement a strong sanitation program that includes timely removal of pruning 
debris from greenhouse and field-grown fresh market tomato production systems.

Phytophthora infestans

Worldwide

The first symptom of late blight is a bending down of petioles of infected leaves. Leaf 
and stem lesions manifest as large, irregular, greenish, water-soaked patches. These 
patches enlarge and turn brown and paper-like. During wet weather, Phytophthora  
infestans will grow and sporulate from lesions on abaxial leaf surfaces. Rapid blighting 
of foliage may occur during moist, warm periods. Entire fields can develop extensive 
foliar and fruit damage. Fruit lesions manifest as large, firm, irregular, brownish-green 
blotches. Surfaces of fruit lesions are rough and greasy in appearance.

Phytophthora infestans can survive on volunteer and home garden tomatoes and 
potatoes, in potato cull piles and on solanaceous weeds, from which it produces 
sporangia that can be carried long distances by storms. Cool, wet weather favors 
development of this disease. Under these conditions disease progresses rapidly and 
can destroy a mature tomato field in a few days. Tomatoes grown in protected culture 
environments (greenhouse, high tunnel) are also subject to late blight infection.  
Disease development may progress even more rapidly in protected culture compared 
to the open field. Phytophthora infestans requires only high humidity to infect, whereas 
many other diseases additionally require leaf wetness for infection to occur.

Implement a late blight forecasting system in conjunction with an effective spray  
program to control late blight. Avoid planting on land previously cropped to potatoes 
or near a potato field because P. infestans is also a pathogen of potato. In protected 
culture, maintaining lower humidity will discourage infection and disease development.

Five races have been described.

Worldwide

Passalora fulva usually infects leaves; however, stems, blossoms, and fruit may also 
be infected. Symptoms first appear as light-green to yellowish areas on the adaxial 
surface of older leaves. This coincides with development of masses of olive-green 
conidia on the abaxial surface of leaves. As disease progresses, lower leaves turn 
yellow and drop. A black, leathery rot may develop on the calyx end of infected fruit. 
Although this disease occurs in the field, it is mainly a problem in greenhouses where 
it spreads rapidly under favorable conditions.

Passalora fulva is an efficient saprophyte and can survive as conidia and sclerotia  
in soil and plant debris for at least one year. Conidia are readily dispersed by wind 
and rain. Dissemination can also occur on workers’ clothing and equipment. High 
(90%) relative humidity and moderate (24°C) temperatures are optimal for disease 
development; however, disease can occur between 10 and 32°C. Leaf mold will not 
develop if relative humidity is less than 85%.

Implement a fungicide spray program. In greenhouses, provide adequate air 
movement and heating to reduce relative humidity to less than 85%. Grow resistant 
varieties when possible; however, the extreme diversity of this fungus often makes it 
difficult to grow a variety resistant to all races of P. fulva present in a region.

Phoma destructiva var. destructiva

Africa, Bolivia, Great Britain, India, Italy, The Netherlands, Pacific Islands, Russia, USA

Phoma rot can affect all above-ground parts of tomato plants. On leaves, this disease 
manifests as numerous small, dark-brown to black spots. Later, the spots may develop 
concentric rings as they enlarge. Older leaves are often infected first; however, all leaves 
are susceptible and defoliation can result when disease is severe. The leaf spot caused 
by Phoma destructiva var. destructiva looks like that caused by Alternaria tomatophila, 
except that the leaf spot caused by P. destructiva var. destructiva contains numerous 
minute, black fruiting bodies (pycnidia). Elongated, dark-brown lesions with concentric 
rings develop on stems. Fruit lesions usually develop at the calyx end and appear as 
small, sunken lesions that later develop into sunken, black, leathery lesions with 
numerous pycnidia in the centers of the lesions. Both green and ripe fruit can be infected. 

Phoma destructiva var. destructiva survives from one season to the next in infected 
tomato and pepper debris. Injuries to plants — such as pruning wounds and other 
mechanical damage, insect feeding, and stem or fruit cracks — provide a means of 
entry for P. destructiva var. destructiva. During periods of high moisture from rain, fog 
or dew, or overhead irrigation, masses of conidia exude from pycnidia. Conidia are 
readily spread by rain, overhead irrigation and on workers’ clothing and equipment. 
Long distance spread occurs with seed and movement of transplant seedlings. Low 
soil nitrogen and phosphorus levels may contribute to plant susceptibility.

Couple a calendar-based fungicide spray program with good sanitation practices to 
reduce losses from Phoma rot. Maintain good soil fertility, practice long crop rotations 
and control solanaceous weeds in and around fields cropped to tomato. Only harvest 
fruit after free moisture from rain or dew has dried from fruit surfaces and avoid 
injuring fruit during harvest. Do not pack fruit when wet.

on upper leaf surfaces. Eventually light, powdery fungal sporulation forms on lower 
leaf surfaces. Under ideal conditions, white, powdery masses of conidia develop on 
both leaf surfaces. As disease progresses, lesions turn necrotic; if disease is severe, 
entire leaves will die. Affected plants may defoliate, resulting in reduced yields and 
small, sunburned fruit.
Oidium neolycopersici and O. lycopersici: Disease first appears as small, circular 
areas of whitish fungal growth with sporulation occurring mainly on upper leaf surfaces. 
As sporulating lesions enlarge, underlying leaf tissue turns yellow, eventually 
becoming brown and shriveled. Sporulation that typically occurs on upper leaf surfaces 
distinguishes Oidium from Leveillula, which typically sporulates on lower leaf 
surfaces. When infection is severe, masses of powdery conidia will cover entire leaf 
surfaces, as well as petioles and calyces; however, fruit remain uninfected. Oidium 
neolycopersici has been reported in field-grown tomato but it is primarily an issue  
for protected culture production.

Leveillula taurica: This fungus has a wide host range on which it can survive and 
spread to tomatoes. Leveillula taurica conidia can travel long distances in air currents 
and can germinate under low (52-75%) relative humidity. Disease development is 
favored by warm (>27ºC) temperatures; however, L. taurica conidia can germinate 
between 10 and 32ºC.
Oidium neolycopersici and O. lycopersici: Optimum conditions for disease 
development include low light intensity and temperatures between 20 and 27ºC 
accompanied by high (85-95%) relative humidity. However, as with L. taurica, 
infection can occur at low (50%) relative humidity.

Several fungicides, including sulfur, can be effective in controlling this disease if good 
coverage is obtained and they are applied in a timely manner. Inorganic bicarbonate 
slates and cupric hydroxide have also been effective in controlling powdery mildews.

Septoria lycopersici

Worldwide

Symptoms first appear as small, dark, water-soaked spots on older leaves. Later, the 
spots enlarge to form circular lesions about five millimeters in diameter. These lesions 
have black or brown borders with gray centers that are peppered with small, black 
pycnidia. Lesions on stems, petioles and calyces tend to be elongated with pycnidia 
developing in centers of lesions. When Septoria leaf spot is severe, lesions coalesce, 
leaves collapse and eventually plants defoliate.

Septoria lycopersici can survive on debris from previous crops as well as on several 
weed hosts including nightshade, horse nettle, jimson weed and ground cherry. 
Extended periods of high (100%) relative humidity and temperatures between 20 and 
25°C favor infection and disease development. Numerous conidia are exuded from 
pycnidia when humidity is high. Conidia can then be spread by wind and splashing 
water from rain or overhead irrigation, and on workers’ clothing and tools, on 
cultivation equipment, and by insects.

Establish a fungicide spray program in conjunction with cultural practices that lower 
inoculum potential such as turning under plant debris or plant debris removal. Rotate  
to a non-host crop for three years to reduce losses from Septoria leaf spot.

Sclerotium rolfsii  (teleomorph: Athelia rolfsii )

This fungus can cause damping-off, crown and root rot, and fruit rot. The first symptom 
on seedlings is a dark-brown lesion at or below the soil line. Stem tissue is invaded 
completely, causing seedlings to quickly damp-off and die. On older plants, developing 
lesions girdle stems, causing plants to wilt without a change in foliage color. These 
lesions may continue expanding to cause root rot below the soil line and may also 
extend several centimeters above it. If moisture is adequate, white mycelium grows 
over lesion surfaces and tan sclerotia (one to two millimeters in diameter) are readily 
formed. Severely infected plants may eventually die. Fruit that contact Sclerotium rolfsii 
are invaded quickly, resulting in sunken, yellowish lesions with ruptured epidermises. 
White mycelium grows from fruit lesions and sclerotia form on lesion surfaces.

Sclerotium rolfsii is an efficient saprophyte and can survive in soil and plant debris for 
several years. This fungus can be spread in surface water and by the movement of 
infested soil on cultivation equipment. High (30-35°C) temperatures and soil moisture 
levels favor disease development.

Regulate soil moisture levels and deep-plow plant residues to reduce losses from 
southern blight. Implement a sanitation program that includes removal or burning of 
all infected plants. Apply fungicides, fumigate soil and rotate from tomato to non-host 
crops like corn, grain sorghum and wheat for three years to reduce losses from 
southern blight.

Corynespora cassiicola

Worldwide

All above-ground parts of tomato plants can be infected by Corynespora cassiicola. 
Symptoms begin on leaves as tiny lesions that rapidly enlarge and develop into 
light-brown lesions with distinct yellow halos. Often, lesions grow together causing 
infected leaf tissue to collapse. Symptoms on stems also begin as small lesions that 
rapidly enlarge and elongate, and may eventually girdle stems, resulting in collapse of 
foliage above where stems were girdled. When disease is severe, numerous leaf and 
stem lesions form on plants causing extensive tissue collapse and eventually plant 
death. Infection of immature fruit begins as minute, dark-brown, sunken spots that 
enlarge as the disease progresses. Large, brown, circular lesions with cracked centers 
develop on mature fruit. Fungal sporulation commonly occurs from these lesions.

Corynespora cassiicola has a broad host range on which it survives. Infection  
occurs when temperatures are between 16 and 32°C during relatively long periods 
(>16 hours) of high moisture. Conidia, which form abundantly on surfaces of 
infected tissues, are spread by air movement and rainfall. 

Initiate a fungicide spray program prior to the onset of symptoms to help reduce 
losses from target spot.

Verticillium albo-atrum
Verticillium dahliae

Worldwide

Wilting of older leaves begins at leaflet margins which progress to yellow then brown 
v-shaped lesions. Older leaves eventually turn yellow and later, necrotic. Affected 
plants are stunted, do not respond to fertilizer or water, and display diurnal wilting 
on sunny days. When the base of the main stem is cut at the crown, a light-tan 
discoloration of vascular and pith tissues can be seen. This discoloration does not 
usually extend up the main stem to any extent, but can be present near the shoot 
tips when disease is severe.

Verticillium albo-atrum and V. dahliae have extremely wide host ranges and can 
survive in plant debris as mycelia and microsclerotia for several years. Disease 
development is favored by moderate (21-25°C) temperatures. These fungi enter 
plants through root wounds caused by cultivation, secondary root formation and 
nematode feeding.

Grow resistant varieties to reduce losses from Verticillium wilt. Soil fumigation and 
solarization have been shown to reduce disease incidence.

Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
Sclerotinia minor

Worldwide

Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and S. minor can infect leaves, stems, petioles and occasionally 
fruit. Initially, water-soaked lesions develop on stems, eventually causing a softening 
of infected areas. Typically, white mycelium grows on stem lesions. A progressive soft 
decay of external tissues is followed by an internal hollowing of pith tissue. Large 
areas of affected stems eventually die and become dry and tan-gray. Irregularly shaped 
black pebble-like bodies called sclerotia develop on surfaces of and inside stems and 
are diagnostic for this disease. Infected fruit develop grayish lesions that quickly turn 
into a watery rot with white mycelium and sclerotia developing on lesion surfaces.

These fungi have a wide host range and can survive as sclerotia in soil and in infested 
plant debris from one season to the next. Sclerotia are the main source of inoculum 
for this disease. Conditions of prolonged moisture from high humidity, frequent rains, 
dews and fog, and cool temperatures (16-21°C) favor disease development. The most 
important means of long-distance spread is airborne ascospores that erupt from sclerotia. 
Moving contaminated soil and fertilizing with manure from animals fed infected plant 
debris are two common ways of short distance spread of sclerotia and mycelium. 
Irrigation water may also spread these fungi within fields and from field to field.

Avoid fields where white mold losses have occurred previously. Plant in well-drained 
soil, use wide row spacing and water very early in the day. Remove all plant debris 
from previous crops. Manure and plant mulches suspected to come from infected 
locations should not be used unless sterilized. Establish a crop rotation with non-host 
crops such as corn, small grains and grasses. Fumigate or steam-sterilize soil to reduce 
soilborne inoculum, and apply fungicides to further reduce losses from white mold.

Broomrape flowering at base of plant.

Broomrape seeds may lie dormant in soil for more than 20 years. Root exudates from 
host plants stimulate germination and young broomrape seedlings attach their roots 
to roots of host plants from which they extract nutrients to grow and reproduce. After 
flowering, very small seeds are produced that can be distributed within and between 
fields as soil is cultivated, on cultivation equipment and in irrigation water. Conditions 
favorable for tomato plant growth also favor broomrape growth and parasitism. 

Extensive dodder infestation in processing tomato field.
Dodder and bindweed infestation in processing tomato field.

Generally, dodder has a very wide host range and is adapted to a wide range of 
environments. After germination, the seedling depends on nutrients stored for its 
survival. If a suitable host is not found within a few days, it will die. Once a seedling 
contacts a host it forms sucker-like projections (haustoria) that penetrate plant 
tissues. Dodder produces small, inconspicuous flowers (often white) that mature and 
produce two to four yellow to black seeds.
Irrigation water and cultivation equipment are common modes of long distance 
dispersal. Dodder seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for up to ten 
years. Seeds usually germinate in late winter and spring in cold climates; however, 
germination can continue through the summer. Environmental conditions that favor 
tomato growth are also beneficial to dodder.

Tomato big bud group of phytoplasmas including:
Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris (aster yellows taxon)
Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia (faba bean phyllody taxon)
Candidatus Phytoplasma trifoli (clover proliferation taxon)
Several additional taxa have been found to be present in tomato plants symptomatic 
for tomato big bud.

Orosius argentatus (Common brown leafhopper)
Macrosteles quadrilineatus (Aster leafhopper)
Neoaliturus tenellus (Beet leafhopper) (synonym = Circulifer tenellus)

This phytoplasma can survive in crops such as hot pepper, lettuce, eggplant and 
potato, as well as weeds such as dock, lambsquarter, nightshade, sowthistle and 
jimson weed, and is readily transmitted to tomato by the common brown leafhopper. 
Transmission occurs when leafhoppers carrying the phytoplasma migrate to tomato 
and feed.

Trialeurodes abutilonea (banded winged whitefly) 
Trialeurodes vaporariorum (greenhouse whitefly)

TICV: Asia, Europe, Middle East, North America, Tunisia
ToCV: Worldwide

Symptoms that develop in TICV- and ToCV-affected plants can be mistaken for 
magnesium or nitrogen deficiency or even pesticide phytotoxicity. First symptoms 
express approximately three to four weeks after initial infection and include 
development of interveinal chlorotic blotches on older leaves while the leaf veins 
remain green. As symptoms progress to younger leaves, the chlorotic blotches turn 
bleached-white or necrotic depending on the variety, and affected leaf tissues 
become brittle. Fruit color may be impacted. Severe losses due to poor fruit set  
have been reported. 

Management of these viruses can be very challenging due to high populations of 
vectors, high vector efficiencies transmitting the viruses and the wide host range of 
vectors and viruses. Chemical and cultural practices have been the primary methods 
used to control these viruses. Although insecticides can reduce whitefly populations, 
this method of control was shown to be inefficient because whiteflies still transmit 
TICV and ToCV before dying from exposure to an insecticide. Also, in the time it takes 
for symptoms of infection to express (three to four weeks), the viruses can be spread 
extensively before symptoms are observed. Use insect exclusion screening (50 mesh/ 
297 micron) on all protected-culture structures to minimize entrance of whiteflies into 
greenhouses. Obtain all transplants from a whitefly-free nursery. Remove all plant 
material from greenhouses after crop completion and implement a plant-free period  
to ensure the absence of whiteflies in greenhouses.

Aphids, whiteflies, thrips and leafhoppers are among the more common vectors 
of viruses that cause severe damage in tomato. The mode of transmission can 
be unique to each virus and vector combination. Transmission ranges from non-
persistent or passive transport of viral particles on external mouth parts to the more 
complex internal virus-vector relationships characteristic of persistent movement. In 
non-persistent movement, virus particles are acquired during feeding or probing of 
infected plants and carried on mouth parts to the next feeding site. Virus acquisition 
takes place within seconds and transmissibility lasts several hours to a day. Longer 
acquisition and inoculation periods characterize persistent transmission. The virus is 
acquired during feeding, but before transmission can occur, the particles must move 
through the digestive system and into the salivary glands. New infections occur during 
feeding when viruliferous vectors inject viable virus particles with saliva into the plant 
cells or vascular tissues of healthy plants. In general, once they become infective, 
persistent vectors can transmit viruses for the duration of their adult lives.
Aphids: Aphids are small, pear-shaped, gregarious insects. They can lay eggs and, 
in warm climates, produce live offspring without mating. Aphids can travel from leaf to 
leaf and plant to plant as wingless nymphs and as winged or wingless adults. Aphids 
usually invade fields as winged adults. Once established, aphids can be found on the 
growing points and on the underside of newer leaves.
Aphids can cause significant damage to tomato, causing spotting and chlorosis of 
leaves, leaf curling and distortion and abscission of flowers. The fungi that cause 
a sooty mold can grow on the sugary honeydew excreted by aphids, reducing fruit 
quality. Two common aphid pests of tomato are the potato aphid (Macrosiphum 
euphorbiae), which is large (3 mm) and colored pink or green, and the green peach 
aphid (Myzus persicae), which is smaller (1.5 mm) and colored light to dark green.
The number and diversity of viruses vectored by aphids far exceed those moved 
around by other vectors. Aphids transmit viruses in both a persistent and non-
persistent manner. There is no evidence to suggest the viruses are carried to the 
next generation via eggs. The viruses carried passively by aphids to tomato can 
be acquired and transmitted within seconds and include Cucumber mosaic virus, 
Tobacco etch virus, and Alfalfa mosaic virus. Viruses persistently transmitted by 
aphids include Potato leaf roll virus and Beet western yellows virus, neither of  
which is a major problem in tomato.
Whiteflies: The greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and sweet potato 
whitefly or silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci; synonym = B. argentifolii ) are serious 
insect pests worldwide. B. tabaci represents a complex of over 35 cryptic species 
[e.g., Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1: formerly termed B biotype), Mediterranean 
(MED: formerly termed Q biotype)] and has emerged as an invasive pest to spread 
viruses worldwide. Over 500 plant species including weeds, vegetable, ornamental 
and agronomic crops are attacked. Immature and adult whiteflies colonize the 
underside of leaves. The larval stages are sedentary, whereas the tiny (1 mm) adults 
fly short distances from leaf to leaf or plant to plant, or are carried for miles by wind. 
Once established, populations build up rapidly due to a life cycle of 20 days or less 
in dry, warm climates. Rain and cold weather reduce whitefly populations. Whiteflies 
feed on phloem and produce sugary honeydew on leaves and fruit. Sooty mold fungi 
colonize the honeydew, reducing fruit quality and yield. Whitefly infestations can also 
slow plant growth and cause stunting and defoliation.

The viruses transmitted by whiteflies are very important in tropical and subtropical 
regions, but are not confined to these areas. In tomato, B. tabaci is an important 
vector of begomoviruses such as Tomato yellow leaf curl, Tomato mottle virus, and the 
numerous begomoviruses found throughout Mexico, and Central and South America. 
T. vaporariorum was shown to transmit Tomato infectious chlorosis virus, a new 
disease in California tomato production regions. These viruses are carried persistently 
or semi-persistently. There is no evidence to suggest that these viruses are passed to 
the offspring of infected adult whiteflies.
Thrips: Five species of thrips are commonly found on tomato. The western 
flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) is native to the western USA, but has been 
introduced into many regions worldwide. The flower thrips (F. tritici), the tobacco 
thrips (F. fusca) and the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) as well as the western flower 
thrips mainly feed on flowers and small fruit. The greenhouse thrips (Heliothrips 
haemorrhoidalis) is found in greenhouses worldwide where it causes damage to a 
wide range of ornamental and vegetable plant species. On tomato, the greenhouse 
thrips mainly feeds on foliage. Generally, thrips reproduce without mating. The 
larvae are relatively inactive, but the tiny adults (<0.5 mm) are winged and mobile. 
Adults live up to 20 days and populations can increase quickly. Egg deposition 
and subsequent feeding by larvae causes discoloration, spotting and scarring in 
developing fruit.
Several species of thrips transmit tospoviruses. Thrips larvae acquire tospoviruses 
after short feeding periods and transmit these viruses primarily as adults. Occasionally 
transmission occurs in nymphs. These viruses are not passed to the next generation; 
however, there is some evidence to support replication in the vector. The western 
flower thrips and the onion thrips are the major vectors of Tomato spotted wilt virus. 
Thrips can also spread pollen-transmitted viruses while feeding and have been 
implicated in the spread of Tomato double virus streak.
Leafhoppers: Leafhoppers are found in warm, dry regions worldwide. They are 
wedge-shaped, green to greenish-yellow to brown and up to 3 mm long. Nymphs 
are similar in shape to adults except they lack fully developed wings. Leafhoppers 
have a very wide host range, including numerous weeds and vegetables. Leafhoppers 
feed on phloem tissues leaving pale, circular spots or peppery specks in leaves. 
Adult females make hatch cuts across leaf veins and stems to insert eggs. Their life 
cycle can be completed in 40 to 45 days under favorable environmental conditions. 
In California, leafhoppers overwinter in weeds, especially those in the foothills of the 
Sierra Nevada and Coast mountain ranges. In spring, as weeds die, leafhoppers move 
into adjacent tomato fields.
The beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus; synonym = Neoaliturus tenellus), transmits 
Beet curly top virus to tomato. This virus is acquired and transmitted persistently 
by immature and adult stages of the beet leafhopper. Once acquired, the virus can 
be transmitted throughout adult life but is not passed to the next generation via the 
egg. The California Department of Food and Agriculture conducts yearly surveys for 
beet leafhoppers and follows an insecticide spray program to control populations of 
beet leafhoppers which helps growers manage beet curly top in processing tomato. 
Several species of leafhopper vector tomato big bud, a disease caused  
by phytoplasmas.

Autogenous Necrosis

Autogenous Necrosis: This genetic disorder is caused by an incompatible reaction 
between a gene (Cf-2 ) for resistance to Passalora fulva, causal agent of leaf mold, 
and a tissue necrosis gene that causes necrotic spots on the foliage under certain 
environmental conditions.
Fruit Pox and Gold Fleck: Although these disorders commonly occur on the same 
fruit, they are distinct and susceptibility to both is genetically inherited. Their 
development is thought to be more severe when fruit are exposed to high temperatures 
and plants and fruit are growing rapidly. However, more work is still needed to fully 
understand the cause. Tomato varieties differ greatly in their susceptibility, with some 
varieties developing only a few lesions or gold flecks, while others develop many.
Zebra Stem: This disorder is associated with tomato varieties that are homozygous 
for Pto gene, which confers resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato race 0. 
This condition is also linked to sensitivity to fenthion, an insecticide.
Zebra Stripe: Symptom expression depends on variety and temperature. High 
temperatures can trigger zebra stripe.

Black Shoulder

Chilling Injury
Cracking
Edema
Gray Wall

Black Shoulder: Drastic changes in environmental conditions and mechanical 
injuries can lead to shoulder cracking. If mature green fruit with shoulder cracking 
remain in the field and are subject to cold (<10°C) temperatures, fruit rot caused 
by Alternaria alternata is likely to occur, leading to development of black shoulder 
symptoms. Although green fruit are more susceptible to shoulder cracking, both 
green and ripe fruit can develop black shoulder.
Catface: Cold (<10°C) weather during flowering and fruit set is known to enhance 
this disorder. Also, high soil nitrogen levels and any disturbance to the flower parts 
during anthesis can increase incidence of catface.
Chilling Injury: Tomatoes are highly sensitive to chilling injury when exposed to 
temperatures between -1 and 12.5°C. Both exposure time (e.g., two weeks at 10°C 
or seven days at 5°C) and fruit maturity can influence severity of damage to fruit. 
Green fruit are more susceptible to chilling injury than ripe fruit. Chilling injury can 
also occur during postharvest storage or in transit.
Catface: on immature green fruit.
Catface: on ripe red fruit.
143
Cracking: Susceptibility to cracking is related to the strength and stretching ability 
of the fruit epidermis. Periods of slow fruit growth followed by rapid growth resulting 
from large differences in day and night temperatures cause fruit cracking. Periods of 
low soil moisture followed by heavy rain or irrigation also cause this disorder.
Edema: This disorder develops when roots take up water faster than it can be used 
by the plant or transpired through the leaves. The main cause is excessively high 
moisture levels in soil or air. Edema typically occurs when the soil temperature is warm 
and the air temperature is cool. Prolonged periods of high humidity favor this disorder.
Gray Wall: Environmental factors that appear to be associated with this disorder 
include high nitrogen content of soil, low potassium content of soil, high soil moisture, 
high humidity, cool weather, low light intensity and soil compaction. In addition, 
certain bacteria and tobacco mosaic virus may play a role in occurrence and 
development of gray wall.

ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES (continued)
Little Leaf
Puffiness
Silvering
Sunscald
Yellow Shoulder
Zippering

147

Little Leaf: This disorder is associated with specific field conditions and specific soil 
microorganisms. Symptoms are often associated with warm soil, poor soil aeration 
(leading to high levels of water saturation), and pH in the neutral to alkaline range. 
Although the exact cause of this disorder is unknown, it is hypothesized that the 
condition of soil and the microorganisms that are supported in the rhizosphere play 
a role in symptom development. It is further hypothesized that the microorganisms 
in the rhizosphere of the plants produce and release compounds that are similar 
in structure to amino acids. These compounds are absorbed by the plants and the 
amino acid-like compounds trigger morphological responses and changes.
Puffiness: Factors that lead to poor seed set and gel formation are high and low 
temperature extremes, use of fruit hormones and soil moisture extremes. High soil 
nitrogen content may exacerbate development of this disorder.
Silvering: Although not well understood, silvering manifests when temperatures drop 
below 18°C. Less silvering develops in protected culture when night temperatures are 
managed well.
Sunscald: Fruit suddenly exposed to direct sunlight due to defoliation from disease, 
pruning or stem breakage are most likely to develop sunscald. Sunscald occurs when 
internal fruit temperature increases and tissue is damaged.
Yellow Shoulder: Varieties that do not ripen uniformly are more susceptible to 
environmental influences that contribute to the development of this disorder than 
varieties that ripen uniformly. If mature fruit are exposed to high temperatures or 
high levels of sunlight (due to insufficient foliar coverage), yellow shoulder symptoms 
may be more pronounced. Plants that are grown in soil with inadequate amounts of 
available potassium are also more susceptible to yellow shoulder.
Zippering: Zippering develops when the anthers attach to the ovary wall of a newly 
developing fruit. Cool temperatures and plant genetics are considered contributing 
factors for this disorder.

When stink bugs feed on green fruit, they puncture the skin and secrete an enzyme 
that prevents development of normal color in ripening fruit. Overwintering stink bug 
adults become active in spring and fly into tomato fields from surrounding weeds. 
Edges of tomato fields nearest weedy areas are often the most affected by stink 
bugs. All growth stages of stink bug species can cause cloudy spot.

Blossom-end rot is associated with insufficient calcium uptake and alternating 
periods of wet and dry soil. Though BER is associated with mature fruit, young, 
rapidly growing fruit are most prone to calcium deficiency. Sudden and extreme 
changes in water availability may induce fruit growth fluctuations that lead to BER. 
Stress associated with root damage, mild drought, high soil salinity, or excess 
nitrogen (excess ammonium) also may cause BER. Incidence of BER may increase 
when relative humidity remains high for prolonged periods due to reduced water 
uptake by plants.

Nutrient deficiencies are most common in acid or alkaline soils due to immobilization 
of nutrients. Low temperatures, soil compaction or excessive soil moisture may also 
affect nutrient availability. Nutrient disorders may also be caused by excessive or 
unbalanced use of fertilizer. Plant diseases that affect plant roots can induce nutrient 
deficiency symptoms due to reduced nutrient uptake.

Herbicide Injury
Insecticide Injury


MCPA: This herbicide causes leaf and stem malformation. Stems may curl, twist, 
and droop whereas leaves may cup and crinkle. Fruit can also be misshapen.
Trifluralin: Lateral and secondary root development is limited. Roots that do form 
tend to be short and stubby.
Insecticide Injury: Insecticides typically cause leaf margin necrosis or necrotic 
lesions on foliage.
Acephate: Applications during high temperatures may cause curling and 
interveinal necrosis, especially on the distal end of leaflets.
Oxamyl: Foliar applications of this nematicide can cause leaf burn if Oxamyl is not 
rinsed well enough from the foliage.
Pylon: “Bleached” leaf spots and leaf burn may develop if this insecticide is applied 
when ambient temperature is high.

Pesticides labeled for use on tomato generally do not cause damage unless they are 
applied at excessive rates, at high temperatures, at the wrong stage of plant growth 
or during unfavorable weather conditions. Some pre-plant herbicides may remain 
active in the soil long enough to cause injury later when seed is sown or seedlings 
are transplanted. Damage may occur from herbicide drift when adjacent crops or 
weeds are sprayed. Usually damage from drift is most severe at the edge of the 
field closest to the pesticide application. Damage from pesticides may occur if spray 
equipment is not rinsed thoroughly after each pesticide application.

Blind seedlings as young as 12 days old have been observed. Several factors have been 
implicated with this disorder: fluctuating temperatures, low light and poor nutrition. 
Supplements of nitrogen and phosphorous were shown to alleviate this disorder but

a plant virus in which the vector acquisition feeding time is short with 
no latent period, no virus replication occurs in the vector and the 
virus can be transmitted by the vector for no more than a few days.
SENESCE Growing old; aging.
SEPAL Modified leaf-like structure that is a unit of the calyx.
SOILBORNE DISEASE Inoculum is carried on or under the soil surface.
SOLANACEAE The nightshade family which includes tobacco, 
tomato, potato, pepper, eggplant, tomatillo and others.
SOLARIZATION Exposure to direct sunlight to raise soil temperatures 
to levels that kill pathogens.
SPORE A reproductive structure of fungi and some bacteria.
SPORULATE To form or produce spores.
STOMA (pl. stomata) A tiny pore in a plant leaf surrounded by a  
pair of guard cells that regulate its opening and closure, and 
serves as the site for gas exchange.
STRAIN A general term referring to (a) an isolate; descendent of 
a pure culture of pathogen, (b) a race; one of a group of similar 
isolates or (c) one of a group of virus isolates that have common 
antigens.
STUNTING A dwarfing or hindering from attaining proper size.
SUSCEPTIBILITY (adj. susceptible) The inability of plants to 
restrict the activities of a specified pest or pathogen.
SYSTEMIC Spreading internally throughout a plant.
TELEOMORPH The sexual form of a fungus.
Ti PLASMID Tumor-inducing plasmid used to transfer genetic 
material from the plasmid to plant cells.
TOLERANCE (adj. tolerant) The ability of plants to endure a  
specified pest, pathogen, environmental pressure or chemical 
stress without serious consequences to growth, appearance or 
yield. A tolerant variety will sustain less damage than a susceptible 
variety when grown under the same conditions.
TOXIN Poison produced by an organism.
TRANSLOCATION The transfer of nutrients or a virus through the plant.
TRANSLUCENCE Transmitting light but diffusing it enough to cause 
images to be blurred.
TRANSPIRATION The loss of water vapor from the surface of leaves.
TRANSPLANT Remove or transfer a young seedling from one place 
to another.
VASCULAR Conductive tissue (xylem, phloem) of a plant.
VECTOR A living organism (e.g., insect, mite, bird, nematode, plant, 
human) able to transmit a pathogen.
VIRUS Very small, submicroscopic disease causing agent.
WATER-SOAKED Tissue having the appearance of being soaked 
with water.
XYLEM The water conducting tissue of a plant.
ZONATE Distinguished from adjacent parts by a distinctive feature 
(such as concentric rings).
