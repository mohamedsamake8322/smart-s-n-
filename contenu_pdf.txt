P R E F A C E
This guide provides descriptions and photographs of the more common tomato diseases and  
disorders worldwide. For each disease and disorder the reader will find the common name, causal 
agent, distribution, symptoms, conditions for disease development and control measures. We have 
also included a section on common vectors of tomato viruses. New to this guide are several bacterial, 
virus and viroid descriptions as well as several tomato disorders. The photographs illustrate  
characteristic symptoms of the diseases and disorders included in this guide. It is important to note, 
however, that many factors can influence the appearance and severity of symptoms. Many of the 
photographs are new to this guide. We are grateful to the many academic and private industry 
individuals who contributed photographs for this guide.
The primary audience for this guide includes tomato crop producers, agricultural advisors, private 
consultants, farm managers, agronomists, food processors, and members of the chemical and vegetable 
seed industries. This guide should be used as a reference for information about common diseases and 
disorders as well as their control. However, diagnosis of these diseases and disorders using only this 
guide is not recommended nor encouraged, and it is not intended to be substituted for the professional 
opinion of a producer, grower, agronomist, plant pathologist or other professionals involved in the 
production of tomato crops. Even the most experienced plant pathologist relies upon laboratory and 
greenhouse techniques to confirm a plant disease and/or disease disorder diagnosis. Moreover, this 
guide is by no means inclusive of every tomato disease. Rather, we present those diseases that are 
currently most prevalent worldwide in protected culture and open field productions. 
Always read and follow label directions for any herbicide, fungicide, insecticide or any other chemical 
used for treatment or control.
A glossary of words used in the text can be found at the end of this guide along with a list of references 
for additional information on the diseases and disorders addressed within this publication.

CAUSAL AGENT
Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis
DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
Symptoms may appear on cotyledons or young leaves as small cream-colored  
spots, expanding to 1-2 mm in diameter, but this is not common. Young plants may 
wilt and die, depending on the initial level of infection. As infected plants mature and 
set fruit, wilting can occur on one side of a leaflet or to leaflets on one side of a leaf. 
This symptom is known as unilateral wilting and is very characteristic of bacterial 
canker. Plants may initially wilt temporarily during the warmest part of the day and 
then recover under cooler conditions. Leaves may exhibit greenish-gray regions of 
collapsed tissue, a symptom more commonly observed in protected culture. 
Secondary infection manifests as necrosis beginning at the margins of leaves and 
spreading inward, known as “firing.” Adventitious roots may develop. As the disease 
progresses, yellow to brown cankers occasionally form longitudinally on stems and 
petioles, hence the name of the disease. Yellow bacterial exudate can sometimes be 
squeezed from the cut end of an infected stem. Longitudinal sectioning of the stem 
reveals yellow to reddish-brown to dark-brown vascular discoloration; pith tissue may 
later deteriorate. Vascular tissue extending from the peduncle into the fruit can have  
a yellow-brown discoloration, particularly in protected culture. Secondary fruit 
symptoms in the field begin as small, white spots which expand and become 
light-brown and raised in the center, surrounded by a white halo. These are referred 
to as “bird’s-eye” spots and can reach 3-6 mm in diameter. In protected culture,  
fruit can exhibit a netted appearance.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Infection generally occurs through wounds in plant tissue, but can also occur through 
stomata, hydathodes or roots. This bacterium has been shown to survive for up to five 
years associated with plant debris and can also survive on weeds, volunteer tomato 
plants and seed. Secondary spread occurs from splashing water, contaminated 
equipment, tools and activities in which plants are handled (e.g., grafting, pruning, 
cultivation, harvesting). Moderate temperatures (18-24°C) and greater than 80% relative 
humidity favor disease development. Soil moisture conditions optimal for plant growth,  
as well as low light intensity and high nutrient levels (especially nitrogen), also enhance 
disease development. Symptoms tend to be more severe in sandy soils.
CONTROL
Sow only seed that has been tested and certified free of Clavibacter michiganensis 
subsp. michiganensis. In seedling production, use only steam-sterilized growing 
media and hard plastic trays, which can be cleaned and sanitized more effectively 
than Styrofoam. Inspect seedlings regularly for bacterial canker symptoms.
Avoid planting tomatoes in fields where C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis has 
been detected within the past five years or where tomatoes or other solanaceous 
crops (e.g., pepper or eggplant) have been grown within the past three years. Use 
new stakes and twine. Sanitize equipment between fields. Overhead irrigation should 
be avoided; drip irrigation is preferred. Avoid activity in the field when plants are wet. 
At the end of the season, crop debris should be thoroughly plowed under.
In protected culture, implement a comprehensive sanitation program for equipment, 
tools and personnel. Manage the greenhouse environment to avoid dew formation  
on plants. Remove pruning debris. Do not interplant; instead, thoroughly clean and 
disinfect production facilities between crops. Do not reuse growing media.

CAUSAL AGENT
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Two races, 0 and 1, have been identified.)
DISTRIBUTION
Race 0 - Worldwide 
Race 1- Bulgaria, Canada, Italy, Serbia and United States 
SYMPTOMS
This bacterium can attack the leaves, stems, petioles, flowers and fruit. Foliar  
symptoms appear as dark-brown to black spots, often surrounded by a yellow halo. 
These lesions can be circular to angular in shape and may have a greasy appearance. 
Lesions can also form on leaf margins where guttation droplets collect. Large areas of 
leaf tissue become necrotic as lesions coalesce. Oval to elongated black lesions may 
occur on stems and petioles. Generally, fruit lesions are superficial and remain small  
(1 mm) and speck-like, but occasionally can be larger and sunken.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Disease development is favored by cool to moderate temperatures (13-25°C) and rainfall  
or sprinkler irrigation. Usually one day of continuous leaf wetness is required for disease  
to develop. Transplant operations provide a conducive environment for bacterial speck 
due to high plant densities and overhead watering. Under these conditions, symptoms 
may express in the transplant operation or remain undetected until after transplanting, 
where rain or overhead irrigation promote disease development and spread. This 
bacterium can survive on many crops and weeds. While an outbreak can originate from 
infested seed, seed transmission is usually of minor importance.

Plant race 0-resistant varieties that carry the Pto gene to effectively control bacterial 
speck where race 0 is present. There is currently no race 1 resistance deployed in  
commercial germplasm. Transplant operations should implement a comprehensive 
sanitation and bactericide spray program. Copper sprays applied early as protectants 
can reduce disease incidence and severity in transplant operations and in the field. 
Avoid sprinkler irrigation; furrow or drip irrigation should be used when possible. 
Control weeds and volunteer tomatoes in and around fields and incorporate debris 
after harvest.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Foliar symptoms appear as dark, water-soaked, circular spots less than 3 millimeters 
in diameter. These spots become angular and the surfaces may appear greasy, with 
translucent centers and black margins. The centers of these lesions soon dry and 
crack, and yellow halos may surround the lesions. During periods of high moisture 
(heavy rain, fog or dew) leaves will turn chlorotic and may eventually become blighted. 
Disease can develop on all above-ground parts of the plant, with lesions tending to be 
more numerous on young foliage. Fruit infection begins as small, black, raised spots 
which may be surrounded by a white, greasy-appearing halo. Fruit lesions typically 
enlarge to four to five millimeters in diameter and can be dark-brown with raised 
margins and sunken, tan centers or tan with raised margins and sunken, dark-brown 
centers. Fruit lesions often appear scab-like or corky.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
These bacteria can survive in crop debris, on volunteer plants, weeds and seed. 
Overhead irrigation can result in rapid spread of this disease in transplant operations.  
In the field, infection generally occurs through wounds, such as those made by insects, 
wind-driven sand and rain, and by high-pressure spraying. Warm temperatures 
(24-30°C) combined with heavy rains or sprinkler irrigation favor disease development.
CONTROL
Sow only seed that has been tested and certified free of these bacteria and ensure 
that transplants are disease-free. Copper sprays can provide moderate levels of 
protection, although copper-resistant strains have become more common. Avoid 
overhead irrigation. Rotate to non-host crops and control weeds and volunteer plants. 
Good sanitation practices, including cleaning of equipment and plowing under all 
plant debris immediately after harvest, can reduce losses from this disease. It is 
valuable to know which race of bacterial spot predominates in an area, as resistant 
tomato varieties may be available.

SYMPTOMS
Bacterial stem rot manifests as wilting in plants with mature green fruit ready for 
harvest. Cross section cuts through the stem usually reveal that pith tissue has rotted 
away and is no longer present. Instead, the stem is hollow. The surface of the stem is 
slimy from the soft rot bacteria that destroyed the pith. Bacterial stem rot can also 
manifest as dark-brown to black lesions on stem surfaces. These lesions can quickly 
elongate along stems. Later, the epidermis and vascular tissues slough off to reveal a 
hollow stem.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Pectobacterium carotovorum is a ubiquitous bacterium that has a wide host range 
among vegetables. Pectobacterium carotovorum can survive for long periods in soil, 
plant debris and water. Both field-grown and greenhouse-grown tomatoes can 
develop bacterial stem rot. Tomatoes grown on trellises or in protected culture are 
managed very differently than processing tomatoes or fresh-market tomatoes that are 
not trellised or staked. The cultivation of trellis-grown tomatoes or of tomatoes grown 
in protected culture requires activities (e.g., pruning, tying and staking plants) that  
can create wounds that allow P. carotovorum to infect and spread within the crop. 
Dispersal of P. carotovorum occurs via splashing rain, irrigation water, tools, equipment, 
workers and insects. In protected culture facilities, P. carotovorum was shown to 
survive under roof gutters where it was splashed onto plants via contaminated water. 
Growing conditions in protected culture that favor bacterial stem rot include high 
relative humidity and free moisture on plants.
CONTROL
Implement a comprehensive sanitation program for workers, tools, equipment and 
facilities for both greenhouse and field-grown tomatoes. Avoid working with plants 
when foliage is wet, and remove infected plants, pruning debris and crop residues.  
In protected culture operations, provide adequate air circulation to reduce relative 
humidity.

DISTRIBUTION

Ralstonia solanacearum: Caribbean, Central America, North America
Ralstonia syzygii subsp. indonesiensis: Indonesia
SYMPTOMS
Onset of disease begins with drooping of lower leaves followed soon after by wilting  
of entire plants. No foliar yellowing is associated with this wilt disease. A longitudinal 
section of stem reveals yellow to light-brown vascular discoloration which may later turn 
dark brown or hollow the stem completely as disease progresses. A quick and simple 
diagnostic method for these Ralstonia species is to place a freshly cut stem in a glass of 
water. A white, milky stream of bacteria will ooze from the stem.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
The Ralstonia solanacearum species complex has a host range of more than 200 plant 
species that it can infect and survive within. These pathogens can also survive in soil 
where they infect roots through natural wounds caused by the formation of secondary 
roots, or through wounds caused by transplanting, cultivation practices or nematode 
feeding. Chewing insects may also transmit these Ralstonia species. These bacteria 
can be spread by rain water or surface irrigation, in soil on cultivation equipment and 
via diseased transplants. Warm (29-35°C) or hot (36-40°C) weather and high soil 
moisture favor development of bacterial wilt.
CONTROL
When possible, avoid land with a history of bacterial wilt. Ensure transplants are  
disease-free and grow hybrid varieties with resistance to bacterial wilt or graft onto  
resistant rootstocks. Transplant onto raised beds, manage soil-moisture content 
including drainage of water away from roots, and control weeds that may serve as 
asymptomatic hosts of these bacteria to reduce incidence and severity of bacterial 
wilt. Soil fumigation or solarization, and cover-cropping or crop rotation to a non-host 
species can reduce incidence of bacterial wilt in some situations.
Yield reduction can approach 100% when disease pressure is high.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Foliar symptoms begin as yellowing and wilting of younger leaves in the upper portions 
of the plant. As the disease advances, dark-brown or black lesions form on stems, 
which can cause wilting and may lead to plant death if the lower stem is affected. A 
longitudinal section of a stem lesion may reveal dark-brown discoloration of pith and 
vascular tissues. Stems may contain hollow or segmented cavities. Adventitious roots 
often develop along stems where pith tissue is affected.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Though pith necrosis occurs in field-grown tomatoes, it is of much greater importance 
in protected culture. Disease outbreaks have been associated with cool night and 
warm day temperatures, high humidity and excessive nitrogen fertilization. The onset 
of symptoms often occurs when fruit reach the mature green stage, especially if plants 
are too vegetative. These bacteria survive variably as pathogens on alternate hosts, in 
tomato debris in soil and as epiphytes on host and non-host species. Spread of these 
bacteria occurs via splashing rain and irrigation water, on contaminated pruning tools 
and equipment, and on workers’ hands during harvest.
CONTROL
Implement a comprehensive hygiene program for workers and sanitize pruning tools 
and other equipment to minimize disease spread. Avoid working with plants when 
they are wet as workers can easily spread bacteria to adjacent plants. In protected 
culture productions, avoid practices that favor increased vegetative growth such as 
excess nitrogen and high humidity.

(synonym = ‘Candidatus Liberibacter psyllarurous’)
VECTOR DISTRIBUTION 
Central America, New Zealand, North America
PATHOGEN DISTRIBUTION 
Central America, Europe, New Zealand, North America
SYMPTOMS
Psyllid yellows are induced by toxins excreted when tomato psyllids feed on plant 
tissue. Interveinal foliar chlorosis is the primary symptom associated with psyllid 
yellows. Yellowing of leaves appears first on older leaves but may also be expressed 
in younger leaves if the psyllid population is not controlled. Foliar chlorosis may be 
paired with vein-clearing and thickening, curled leaves, older leaves with a leathery 
texture, younger leaves with a purple hue, and stunting. Symptom severity can be 
reduced by controlling the psyllid vector.
Vein-greening occurs when tomato psyllids transmit the obligate bacterial pathogen, 
‘Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum.’ Vein-greening symptoms may also  
be accompanied by typical symptoms of psyllid yellows. Flower and fruit production 
may be affected, with an increase in flower production but an overall decrease in the 
number of flowers that set fruit. Of the fruit that are produced, most are discolored, 
deformed, smaller than normal, and have a reduced sugar content. As the infection 
progresses, symptoms may escalate to foliar necrosis, widespread wilting, and death 
of the plant.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
The tomato psyllid grows and reproduces at warm temperatures (24-26°C is optimal). 
An increased psyllid population can be correlated to increased symptoms of psyllid 
yellows. If the psyllids are transmitting ‘Ca. L. solanacearum,’ it can be expected that 
symptoms of vein-greening will also be more prevalent at warm temperatures due to 
increased proliferation of the vector.
CONTROL
The primary control measure for psyllid yellows and vein-greening is management  
of the psyllid vector. Monitor the presence of the vector using yellow sticky traps 
to ensure the timely application of insecticides. Insecticides that are active against 
psyllids at all life stages are the most effective in eliminating the vector and psyllid 
yellows symptoms. Predatory insects may also be utilized as a source of biological 
control for the psyllid vector, although their effectiveness may be limited. Predators  
of psyllids include a parasitic wasp (Tamarixia triozae), lady beetles, lacewings and 
damsel bugs.
Eliminating the psyllid vector following transmission of the pathogen, ‘Ca. L.  
solanacearum’, will not alleviate symptoms of vein-greening; however, insecticide  
treatments will help minimize spread from infected to healthy plants. Once tomato 
plants are infected with the bacterium they cannot be cured. In some greenhouse 
environments, severity of vein-greening symptoms can be lessened with application of 
micronutrient solutions. Other cultural practices, including crop rotation and roguing  
of alternate hosts and solanaceous weeds, can help minimize available vector habitat.

CAUSAL AGENT
Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
Symptoms caused by Pseudomonas syringae  pv. syringae can be easily confused 
with symptoms caused by P. syringae pv. tomato. Symptoms on leaves may vary  
from brown lesions that lack a chlorotic halo to dark-brown or black lesions with 
surrounding bright-yellow halos. Syringae leaf spot lesions can be larger than those  
of bacterial speck; however, it is necessary to isolate the causal agent in pure culture 
and conduct laboratory tests to determine etiology.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
This bacterium survives on both host and non-host plants as an epiphyte and can 
spread from these plants when cool, wet environmental conditions favor disease 
development. Although economic damage from this disease is often limited, infection  
at the seedling stage can be severe under ideal environmental conditions. Wounding  
is often associated with infection although this bacterium can also enter via natural 
openings in leaves (e.g., stomata, hydathodes). Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae is 
a weak, opportunistic pathogen on tomato, and overall disease development may be 
less than that caused by P. syringae pv. tomato.
CONTROL
Control may be obtained with copper-based spray applications, though this is usually 
not necessary since economic damage from P. syringae pv. syringae  is not common. 
Nurseries should implement a comprehensive hygiene program and apply bactericides 
as protectants rather than in response to symptoms developing on seedlings. Avoid 
low temperature and high humidity conditions in nurseries. Inspect seedlings for 
symptoms before transplanting to avoid introducing disease into the field. Abstain 
from using overhead irrigation whenever possible. If a bacterial disease is suspected, 
samples should be submitted to a reputable laboratory to determine if symptoms are 
caused by P. syringae pv. syringae and not by another bacterial pathogen that might 
require more stringent control.

Agrobacterium radiobacter biovar 1
DISTRIBUTION 
Europe, Japan, New Zealand, North America, Russia
SYMPTOMS
The primary symptom is dense proliferation of roots against the inside surface of 
artificial substrate cubes and slabs. The swelling of the substrate cube is quite 
noticeable. Roots of affected plants lack branching and are thicker than healthy 
tomato roots. Affected plants produce additional vegetative growth, which can lead 
to poor fruit set and smaller fruit. Affected plants may also be more sensitive to other 
pathogens (e.g., Pythium spp.).
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Strains of Agrobacterium radiobacter biovar 1 can harbor a root-inducing (Ri) 
plasmid, pRi. Infection of tomato by A. radiobacter occurs through root wounds. Root 
mat symptoms develop following insertion of T-DNA of pRi into tomato root cells. 
Once present in a propagation house or greenhouse, A. radiobacter is very difficult  
to eradicate despite aggressive hygiene programs and use of new substrate each 
crop cycle due to its ability to survive as biofilms on surfaces of production facilities. 
Agrobacterium radiobacter has been found colonizing the rhizosphere of several 
weed species which grow in and around protected culture facilities. Moreover,  
A. radiobacter can survive in soils for many years ( >15 years). Sources of infection 
have been attributed to contaminated water silos, drain water, irrigation lines and  
drip emitters.
CONTROL
There is no registered chemical treatment that can be applied to tomato plants  
during cultivation. Implement a strict hygiene program to limit the persistence of  
A. radiobacter within nursery and production houses to keep tomato root mat under 
control. Thoroughly clean and sanitize production facilities between tomato crops. 
Control weeds in areas surrounding nurseries and production facilities. Treat 
recirculated water systems with UV light. Never re-use artificial substrate (e.g., rock 
wool, coco peat). Suppress A. radiobacter by lowering irrigation water to pH 5.0. 
Many horticultural disinfectants have activity against A. radiobacter. Products with  
a sodium hypochlorite (5 ppm) or hydrogen peroxide (15 ppm) base are  
especially effective.

Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici
DISTRIBUTION
USA (California)
SYMPTOMS
Symptoms may occur on all above-ground parts of tomato plants. Dark-brown 
cankers that are often associated with wound sites form on stems. These cankers 
develop concentric rings as they enlarge. Dry, brown stem rots develop with brown 
streaks extending into pith tissue above and below cankers. A toxin produced by 
Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici moves from the stem cankers into upper parts  
of affected plants, killing interveinal leaf tissue. As this disease progresses, curling of 
leaf margins and then leaf senescence occurs. Often, stem cankers eventually girdle 
stems, which leads to plant death. Fruit symptoms initially appear as small, gray 
flecks which later enlarge and become dark and sunken with characteristic concentric 
rings. Symptoms may not be present on mature green fruit; however, symptoms can 
develop rapidly with ripening in transit.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici can survive in soil and crop debris for more than  
one year. Stem wounds created by pruning allow entry of this fungus into plants; however, 
infection also occurs without wounds. Rain, overhead irrigation and dews favor 
development of Alternaria stem canker. Conidia that sporulate from cankers are easily 
spread by wind to initiate infection on additional plants.
CONTROL
Use of resistant varieties effectively controls this disease. Fungicides have not shown 
good efficacy against A. alternata f. sp. lycopersici.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Infection of fruit, stems, leaves and roots may occur, with fruit and root infections being 
most serious. Although green fruit are readily infected, symptoms do not appear until 
fruit ripen. Initial lesions are sunken, circular and develop concentric rings as they 
expand. Lesion centers turn tan where many dark microsclerotia develop within 
lesions. During wet weather, numerous conidia form in slimy, salmon-colored and 
gelatin-like masses on lesion surfaces. Infected roots develop brown lesions with 
microsclerotia developing on root surfaces. Colletotrichum coccodes is most 
commonly associated with fruit symptoms and is the only Colletotrichum species 
associated with black dot root rot. Root infection is commonly associated with another 
common soilborne disease of tomato called corky root rot, which is caused by 
Pyrenochaeta lycopersici. Leaf infection is rarely a problem and is characterized  
by small, brown, circular lesions surrounded by yellow halos.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
These fungi are generally considered weak pathogens; however, they have a wide 
host range (more than 65 plant species) and can survive in soil on decaying plant 
tissue for several years. Free moisture and temperatures between 10 and 30°C 
favor host infection. The longer fruit surfaces remain wet from rainfall or overhead 
irrigation, the greater the disease severity. Conidia and microsclerotia infect host 
tissue directly in contact with infested soil or they are disseminated to host tissue by 
splashing rain and overhead irrigation. These fungi penetrate host tissue directly or 
enter through wounds. Root infection generally occurs when fungal inoculum levels 
are high and plants are nutritionally stressed due to unfavorable growing conditions  
or infection from another pathogen, especially P. lycopersici.
CONTROL
Initiate a fungicide spray program at the first green fruit stage and continue until 
harvest to help control this disease. To further reduce losses from these fungi choose 
fields that drain well, avoid root injury during cultivation, remove weeds and infected 
debris from fields and apply a broad spectrum fumigant in the offseason. Rotate to 
non-host crops for two to three years to prevent buildup of inoculum in soil.

DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
The Phytophthora species that cause buckeye fruit and root rot can infect all parts  
of tomato plants. They can cause seedling damping-off, root and crown rot, foliar 
blight and fruit rot. Root rot symptoms include large, brown, sunken, and water-soaked 
lesions on secondary roots and the tap root that can extend above the soil line onto 
the stem. As disease progresses, smaller roots collapse and decay. A longitudinal 
section through the tap root reveals a chocolate-brown discoloration of the vascular 
system that extends a short distance beyond the lesion. Severely infected plants  
eventually wilt and die. Infected leaves initially develop water-soaked, irregular-shaped 
lesions that collapse quickly and dry. Stem lesions can develop at any level on stems 
but are typically found near the soil line. Stem lesions are dark-green and water-soaked 
at first, and eventually become dry and brown. As stem lesions expand they can 
completely girdle stems, causing pith tissue to turn brown and collapse. Fruit 
symptoms start as grayish-brown, water-soaked lesions that expand rapidly, forming 
brown concentric rings that resemble a buckeye nut—hence the name. Brown 
discoloration can extend into fruit centers with young green fruit becoming 
mummified, while mature fruit quickly rot from invasion by secondary organisms.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
These Phytophthora species have a relatively wide host range and can survive in 
soil and infested plant debris for at least two years. They can be spread by irrigation 
water and farm equipment. Initial infection is favored by moderate soil moisture levels 
and temperatures (20°C). Excessive irrigation or rain, in combination with heavy or 
compacted soils, favors further disease development.
CONTROL 
Use fungicides in combination with cultural practices to manage buckeye fruit and 
root rot. Plant on raised beds to promote water drainage away from plant roots, 
avoid compacting field soil and fields with poorly drained soil, and irrigate for shorter 
lengths of time to avoid extended periods of soil saturation. Mulch or stake plants to 
raise fruit off soil. Follow a three-year rotation to non-host crops.

equipment, readily disseminate conidia of this pathogen.
CONTROL 
Use a calendar-based protectant fungicide spray program and resistant varieties to 
reduce losses from Cercospora leaf mold. Prune and provide adequate plant spacing 
to encourage air movement within plant canopies, and mulch and furrow or drip  
irrigate to reduce spread of this pathogen from splashing water. Turn under or remove

sometimes referred to as “black leaf mold” because of this dark fungal sporulation. 
When Cercospora leaf mold is severe, lesions coalesce resulting in collapse of leaf

CAUSAL AGENT 
Pyrenochaeta lycopersici
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide 
SYMPTOMS 
Infected plants may be stunted and generally lack vigor. As disease progresses,  
plants may show diurnal wilting and develop leaf chlorosis and premature defoliation. 
First symptoms on small roots are smooth, elliptical, light-brown lesions. This stage 
of the disease is frequently called brown root rot. As disease progresses, primary 
and secondary roots are infected and develop large brown lesions that swell and 
crack longitudinally, giving them a corky appearance. Feeder roots may be decayed 
completely and no longer present. The tap root and stem base eventually turn brown 
and rot.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
This fungus is pathogenic on several agricultural crops, and its microsclerotia can 
survive in soil and tomato root debris for several years. Disease is most severe under 
cool (15-20°C) soil temperatures and relatively high soil moisture; however, strains 
from warmer climates were found to be pathogenic at soil temperatures between 
26 and 30°C. Spread of Pyrenochaeta lycopersici occurs with cultivation and on 
contaminated farm equipment.
CONTROL 
Soil fumigation is the most effective means of controlling this disease. Grafting onto 
corky root rot-resistant rootstocks has been used effectively for greenhouse tomato 
production.

DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Pre-emergence damping-off: Seeds may rot before germinating or seedlings may 
die prior to emergence.
Post-emergence damping-off: Young seedlings develop a rot at the crown; later, 
the tissue becomes soft and constricted and plants wilt and collapse.
Pythium species and Phytophthora species: Symptoms of pre-emergence 
damping-off include dark-brown to black water-soaked lesions that rapidly spread 
over the entire seedling. Post-emergence damping-off is characterized by brown 
water-soaked lesions that first appear on the roots and spread up the hypocotyl above 
the soil line, eventually girdling the hypocotyl and causing the seedling to wilt and die.
Rhizoctonia solani: Pre-emergence damping-off is characterized by tan to reddish-
brown lesions developing on the hypocotyl and by death of the growing tip. Symptoms 
of post-emergence damping-off include reddish-brown to black lesions developing 
on roots and the hypocotyl at or below the soil line. Later the hypocotyl constricts and 
the infected seedling quickly wilts and dies. Rhizoctonia solani can also infect older 
plants; however, as plants mature they become more tolerant to infection, and lesions 
are usually restricted to cortical tissue.
Botrytis cinerea: Post-emergence damping-off can occur in the nursery as 
cotyledons senesce. It is characterized by beige to brown discoloration of the 
hypocotyl. If not properly controlled early, presence of Botrytis cinerea can lead to 
additional problems on all parts of the tomato plant during the vegetative stage.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
These fungi are capable of surviving for long periods of time in soil and may persist 
in plant debris or on roots of weeds. Damping-off tends to be most severe under 
conditions of high soil moisture, overcrowding, compaction, poor ventilation and 
cool, damp, cloudy weather. In greenhouses, damping-off can be problematic when 
soil is not pasteurized completely or when seedling trays are inadequately sanitized. 
Water splashing can move infested soil from diseased to healthy seedlings. The water 
source can be a potential cause for introducing these damping-off pathogens into  
a protected or open-field environment.
CONTROL 
Improving drainage and moisture regulation to prevent soil saturation reduces 
damping-off. Fungicidal soil drenches and seed treatments are available to help 
manage damping-off. Rotation to cereal crops and soil fumigation or solarization  
may reduce damping-off in the field. Use pasteurized soil mixes in nurseries.

CAUSAL AGENT 
Didymella lycopersici (anamorph: Phoma lycopersici)
DISTRIBUTION 
Africa, Australia, Canada, Europe, Great Britain, India, New Zealand 
SYMPTOMS 
Infection usually occurs on stems at or above the soil line; however, all foliar parts 
of tomato plants can be affected. Dark-brown, sunken lesions form on the stem at 
the base of the plant. These lesions eventually expand and girdle the stem, which 
results in yellowing and wilting of older leaves. As wilting progresses, the plant may 
eventually die. Numerous black pycnidia, which is the asexual fruiting structure of this 
fungus, frequently form in stem lesions. Splashing water spreads conidia formed within 
pycnidia to stems, leaves and fruit, resulting in additional infections and disease 
spread. Leaf infection begins as small spots which develop into brown lesions with 
concentric rings. Pycnidia may develop in the center of these lesions with leaves 
eventually taking on a shot-hole appearance or dying. Fruit infection typically occurs 
at the calyx end and appears as a water-soaked lesion that progresses rapidly to form 
a sunken black lesion with concentric rings.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Didymella lycopersici can survive in soil, in infected plant debris and seed, as well 
as on nightshade and other solanaceous hosts. Didymella stem rot occurs over a 
wide range of conditions; however, a temperature of 20°C accompanied by splashing 
water from rain or overhead irrigation is optimal for disease development and spread. 
Plants become more susceptible as they mature, and nitrogen and phosphorus 
deficiency can exacerbate disease severity.
CONTROL 
Fungicide spray programs can be effective if properly applied in a timely manner.  
Practice good sanitation including removal of all infected plant debris and alternate 
hosts. A three-year crop rotation between tomato crops can reduce losses from this 
disease. Avoid overhead irrigation and provide adequate ventilation when growing 
plants in a greenhouse.

EARLY BLIGHT
CAUSAL AGENTS 
Alternaria tomatophila 
Alternaria solani
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Symptoms may develop on leaves, stems and fruit and typically appear first on older 
leaves as irregular, dark-brown, necrotic lesions. These lesions expand as disease 
progresses and they eventually develop concentric, black rings, which give early blight 
lesions a target-board appearance. A chlorotic area often surrounds leaf lesions. If 
there are numerous lesions on a leaf, then the entire leaf will turn yellow and senesce. 
Complete defoliation of plants can occur when conditions are favorable for disease 
development. Lesions may appear as dark-brown, elongated, sunken areas on stems 
and petioles. Lesion development at the soil line can result in collar rot that may girdle 
stems. Fruit lesions often occur at the calyx end and are dark, leathery and sunken.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Alternaria tomatophila and A. solani generally survive from season to season on plant 
debris in the soil. Volunteer tomatoes, potatoes and solanaceous weeds can also serve 
as inoculum sources. Infection and sporulation occur during periods of warm 
(24-29°C), humid or rainy weather. Conidia are disseminated from sporulating lesions 
by wind and rain. Early blight spreads rapidly when favorable conditions persist. This 
disease can also be serious in arid climates when dew periods are frequent or when 
the crop is sprinkler-irrigated.
CONTROL 
A fungicide spray program combined with an early blight forecasting system is the 
most effective means of controlling this disease. Use field sanitation techniques such 
as crop rotation and weed control, and turn under or remove debris from previous 
crops to reduce disease severity.

DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Both bacteria and fungi can enter through natural openings like stem scars or  
through growth cracks and wounds caused by insect feeding and mechanical damage. 
In general, warm (25-30°C) temperatures and high humidity provide adequate  
conditions for bacteria and fungi to infect fruit. However, gray mold rot can be  
problematic under cool to moderate (18-23°C) temperatures and wet conditions. 
CONTROL 
Cultural methods which keep fruit from contacting the soil help prevent many of the 
fruit rots. Improve air movement in the field by orienting rows in the direction of 
prevailing winds, and use proper row and plant spacing to shorten the length of time 
that fruit remain wet. Schedule sprinkler irrigation to minimize the length of time that 
free water remains on fruit. Fungicides may offer some protection against some fruit 
rots. Tomato varieties which produce firm fruit and those that are resistant to fruit 
cracking may escape infection by some fruit rots.
Avoid fruit injury during harvest and packing. Field and packinghouse sanitation  
is effective at reducing losses due to fruit rots. Sanitize all harvest equipment, the 
packing line and packing boxes daily. Maintain a minimum available chlorine 
concentration of 150 ppm at pH 6.0-7.5 in dump tank and packing line wash water.  
Cull infected and injured fruit during packing. Dry wet fruit surfaces before packing 
and cool fruit quickly to 10ºC.

DISEASE
ORGANISM
SYMPTOMS
Bacterial soft rot
Pectobacterium carotovorum, Dickeya  
chrysanthemi
A light- to dark-colored, sunken lesion is usually the first symptom to develop. As the lesion expands, 
it takes on a soft rot appearance. Bacteria may ooze from cracks in the fruit epidermis.
Black mold rot
Alternaria alternata, Pleospora lycopersici, 
Stemphylium botryosum, S. consortiale
Symptoms can range from superficial flecking to brown-black, dry, sunken lesions which may extend 
into fruit cavities. V-shaped lesions often develop on the stem scar and with adequate humidity,  
a dense layer of black fungal conidia develops on lesion surfaces.
Gray mold rot
Botrytis cinerea
Lesions begin as gray-green to gray-brown, water-soaked spots. They usually form on the  
calyx end of fruit and quickly expand to form gray-brown sporulating lesions which later develop  
into a watery rot.
Pythium fruit rot
Pythium aphanidermatum, P. ultimum
Lesions begin as water-soaked spots on both green and ripe fruit. Lesions quickly expand, engulfing 
entire fruit and giving fruit a water balloon appearance. When humidity is high, a white cottony 
growth covers lesion surfaces. When the epidermis is ruptured, fruit quickly collapse.
Rhizoctonia fruit rot
Rhizoctonia solani
Lesions begin as a firm rot which later becomes soft. Rhizoctonia fruit rot usually develops on ripe 
fruit that contact the soil. It is often characterized by rings that form in the infected area. A brown 
fungal growth frequently develops on the surface of infected fruit.
Rhizopus rot
Rhizopus stolonifer
Lesions develop rapidly and have a puffy, water-soaked appearance. White mycelium interspersed 
with fungal spore masses borne on raised stalks form on the surface of lesions. Rhizopus rot tends  
to have a fermented odor compared to the putrid odor of bacterial soft rot and sour rot.
Sour rot
Geotrichum candidum, G. penicillatum
Sour rot can develop on mature green fruit as well as ripe fruit. This rot usually begins at the stem 
scar and may extend in sectors down the side of fruit. A dull white fungal growth often develops from 
cracks in the skin. Fruit often remain firm until the rot is advanced and then a sour odor develops. 
Under favorable conditions infection can proceed rapidly on ripe fruit.

FUSARIUM CROWN AND ROOT ROT
CAUSAL AGENT 
Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp. radicis-lycopersici
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Typically, first symptoms are observed when plants are at the mature-green fruit 
stage. Symptoms include a yellowing of the oldest leaves that gradually progresses  
to the youngest leaves. When Fusarium crown and root rot is severe, plants may wilt 
quickly and die; however, diurnal wilting during hot, sunny days is more common. As 
disease progresses the entire root system of affected plants turns brown and the tap 
root often rots away. Chocolate-brown lesions develop at or near the soil line and 
extend into the vascular system. This brown vascular discoloration typically does not 
extend more than 25 cm above the soil line, which helps to distinguish this disease 
from Fusarium wilt. When humidity is adequate, fungal sporulation may be observed 
on exposed lesions. 
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp. radicis-lycopersici can survive in the soil, on infected 
plants and on the roots of alternative hosts (e.g., eggplant, pepper and several 
legume crops) for several years. Fungal conidia can be spread in soil by farm 
machinery, in irrigation water and through the air. Infection takes place through 
feeder roots and wounds caused by secondary root formation. Disease development 
is favored by cool (20°C) soil temperatures. In protected environments, infection is 
often observed at the graft union of the scion and rootstock or at sites where pruning 
has occurred.
CONTROL 
The use of varieties and rootstocks resistant to Fusarium crown and root rot is the 
most effective way to control this disease. Implement a thorough hygiene program  
for workers, tools and equipment to mitigate disease severity and reduce the  
spread of this pathogen in protected culture. Practices such as inter-planting and  
year-round production can have a negative effect on controlling F. oxysporum  f. sp. 
radicis-lycopersici as growers are unable to properly sanitize their facilities. Soil 
fumigation does not appear to be an effective control measure due to rapid 
colonization of sterilized soil by the fungus. Biologicals (e.g., Trichoderma) applied  
to artificial substrates in protected environments may have some impact on  
reducing the spread of this pathogen.

DISTRIBUTION 
Australia, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Turkey, USA
SYMPTOMS 
Fusarium foot rot manifests on mature plants as leaf interveinal chlorosis and 
necrosis. In severe cases, leaves turn brown and collapse, and the entire plant may 
die. Reddish, dark-brown lesions form on the taproot and main lateral roots up to  
30 cm below the soil line. Internal vascular discoloration may extend two to ten 
centimeters beyond lesions.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Fusarium solani f. sp. eumartii can survive in soil for two to three years. Cooler 
temperatures favor disease development, even though this fungus can grow well at  
a soil temperature of 27°C. Infection occurs through root wounds. Recently, both  
F. solani f. sp. eumartii and F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici have become 
important diseases in protected culture. 
CONTROL 
Use fungicides, fumigate or solarize soil, and rotate to a non-host crop for four years 
to reduce losses from Fusarium foot rot. Today, there are no resistance claims among 
tomato varieties and rootstocks against F. solani f. sp. eumartii.

Three races have been described.
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Infected seedlings are stunted and the oldest leaves and cotyledons turn yellow and 
wilt. Severely infected seedlings frequently die. On older plants symptoms begin with 
a yellowing of the oldest leaves at fruit set. Symptoms are often characterized by 
a yellowing on only one side of a leaf or branch. Later entire branches turn yellow 
producing a “yellow flag” appearance in the field. Affected leaves wilt and die, though 
they remain attached to the stem. Affected plants are often stunted and may display 
diurnal wilting during sunny days. A characteristic red-brown discoloration of vascular 
tissue develops in affected plants and can be seen if the main stem is cut longitudinally 
or when a branch is snapped off the main stem. Vascular discoloration may extend 
throughout the main stem and side branches or even further.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici can survive in soil for several years and is 
spread by farm machinery during cultivation. This fungus can also be spread in 
infected plant debris and in irrigation water. Infection takes place through root wounds 
caused by cultivation, secondary root formation and nematode feeding. Disease 
develops quickly when soil temperatures are warm (28°C). Fusarium wilt is enhanced 
by high levels of micronutrients, and phosphorous and ammonia nitrogen.
CONTROL 
Today three races of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici are recognized and they are 
designated as race 1, 2 and 3 in the United States and as race 0, 1 and 2 in Europe. 
The use of resistant varieties is the most effective way to control Fusarium wilt.  
Thoroughly disinfect equipment before moving from infested to clean fields.

DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide 
SYMPTOMS 
Leaf lesions appear as small, brownish-black specks. These lesions develop into 
grayish-brown, glazed, angular lesions approximately three millimeters in diameter. 
They are often surrounded by chlorosis. The lesions eventually dry and tissue in the 
center of the lesions cracks. When numerous lesions develop on leaves, entire leaves 
turn chlorotic and drop, which may lead to defoliation. Tomato fruit and stems are not 
affected by these fungi.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
These fungi can survive in soil and on plant debris from one year to the next. In 
addition, volunteer tomato plants, as well as other solanaceous crops and weeds, can 
serve as inoculum sources. Infected transplants may also be an important inoculum 
source. Conidia sporulate from infected leaves and are spread by wind and splashing 
water. Warm and humid or wet weather are favorable for disease development. Gray 
leaf spot can also develop in arid regions when dew periods are long or if the crop is 
sprinkler irrigated.
CONTROL 
Widespread use of resistant varieties has reduced the importance of this disease. Use 
fungicides to control gray leaf spot if the variety being grown is susceptible to this 
disease. Remove plant debris and provide adequate ventilation in seedling beds.

Botrytis cinerea  (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana)
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Botrytis cinerea can infect all above ground parts of tomato plants and typically 
enters through wounds. On stems, initial infections appear as elliptical, water-soaked 
lesions. These lesions develop under high humidity into a gray, moldy growth, which 
can girdle and kill plants. Stem lesions often show concentric banding. Leaf infections 
usually begin at points of injury and develop into v-shaped lesions that are covered 
with gray fungal sporulation. Botrytis cinerea commonly infects the calyx end of fruit 
where it can spread rapidly, forming gray-brown sporulating lesions that later develop 
into a watery rot. Ghost spot, an unusual fruit symptom, is characterized by small, white 
to pale-yellow or green rings that develop on green or red fruit. Ghost spot rings result 
when B. cinerea infects fruit but further disease development is halted when fruit are 
exposed to direct sunlight and high temperatures. Ghost spots reduce market quality.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Botrytis cinerea has a wide host range. It is an efficient saprophyte and can survive  
in soil and infected plant debris for long periods in the form of sclerotia. It is considered 
a weak parasite and typically infects plant tissues through wounds. When humidity  
is adequate, gray masses of fungal spores are produced, which are readily wind- 
disseminated. Overcast, cool and humid conditions are required for disease development. 
Close plant spacing and poor ventilation can lead to severe gray mold problems.
CONTROL 
Reduce losses from this disease with an appropriate fungicide spray program. Provide 
adequate ventilation to plants by pruning and subsequently applying fungicide to pruning 
wounds. Implement a strong sanitation program that includes timely removal of pruning 
debris from greenhouse and field-grown fresh market tomato production systems.

CAUSAL AGENT 
Phytophthora infestans
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
The first symptom of late blight is a bending down of petioles of infected leaves. Leaf 
and stem lesions manifest as large, irregular, greenish, water-soaked patches. These 
patches enlarge and turn brown and paper-like. During wet weather, Phytophthora  
infestans will grow and sporulate from lesions on abaxial leaf surfaces. Rapid blighting 
of foliage may occur during moist, warm periods. Entire fields can develop extensive 
foliar and fruit damage. Fruit lesions manifest as large, firm, irregular, brownish-green 
blotches. Surfaces of fruit lesions are rough and greasy in appearance.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Phytophthora infestans can survive on volunteer and home garden tomatoes and 
potatoes, in potato cull piles and on solanaceous weeds, from which it produces 
sporangia that can be carried long distances by storms. Cool, wet weather favors 
development of this disease. Under these conditions disease progresses rapidly and 
can destroy a mature tomato field in a few days. Tomatoes grown in protected culture 
environments (greenhouse, high tunnel) are also subject to late blight infection.  
Disease development may progress even more rapidly in protected culture compared 
to the open field. Phytophthora infestans requires only high humidity to infect, whereas 
many other diseases additionally require leaf wetness for infection to occur.
CONTROL 
Implement a late blight forecasting system in conjunction with an effective spray  
program to control late blight. Avoid planting on land previously cropped to potatoes 
or near a potato field because P. infestans is also a pathogen of potato. In protected 
culture, maintaining lower humidity will discourage infection and disease development.

Five races have been described.
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Passalora fulva usually infects leaves; however, stems, blossoms, and fruit may also 
be infected. Symptoms first appear as light-green to yellowish areas on the adaxial 
surface of older leaves. This coincides with development of masses of olive-green 
conidia on the abaxial surface of leaves. As disease progresses, lower leaves turn 
yellow and drop. A black, leathery rot may develop on the calyx end of infected fruit. 
Although this disease occurs in the field, it is mainly a problem in greenhouses where 
it spreads rapidly under favorable conditions.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Passalora fulva is an efficient saprophyte and can survive as conidia and sclerotia  
in soil and plant debris for at least one year. Conidia are readily dispersed by wind 
and rain. Dissemination can also occur on workers’ clothing and equipment. High 
(90%) relative humidity and moderate (24°C) temperatures are optimal for disease 
development; however, disease can occur between 10 and 32°C. Leaf mold will not 
develop if relative humidity is less than 85%.
CONTROL 
Implement a fungicide spray program. In greenhouses, provide adequate air 
movement and heating to reduce relative humidity to less than 85%. Grow resistant 
varieties when possible; however, the extreme diversity of this fungus often makes it 
difficult to grow a variety resistant to all races of P. fulva present in a region.

Phoma rot can affect all above-ground parts of tomato plants. On leaves, this disease 
manifests as numerous small, dark-brown to black spots. Later, the spots may develop 
concentric rings as they enlarge. Older leaves are often infected first; however, all leaves 
are susceptible and defoliation can result when disease is severe. The leaf spot caused 
by Phoma destructiva var. destructiva looks like that caused by Alternaria tomatophila, 
except that the leaf spot caused by P. destructiva var. destructiva contains numerous 
minute, black fruiting bodies (pycnidia). Elongated, dark-brown lesions with concentric 
rings develop on stems. Fruit lesions usually develop at the calyx end and appear as 
small, sunken lesions that later develop into sunken, black, leathery lesions with 
numerous pycnidia in the centers of the lesions. Both green and ripe fruit can be infected. 
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Phoma destructiva var. destructiva survives from one season to the next in infected 
tomato and pepper debris. Injuries to plants — such as pruning wounds and other 
mechanical damage, insect feeding, and stem or fruit cracks — provide a means of 
entry for P. destructiva var. destructiva. During periods of high moisture from rain, fog 
or dew, or overhead irrigation, masses of conidia exude from pycnidia. Conidia are 
readily spread by rain, overhead irrigation and on workers’ clothing and equipment. 
Long distance spread occurs with seed and movement of transplant seedlings. Low 
soil nitrogen and phosphorus levels may contribute to plant susceptibility.
CONTROL 
Couple a calendar-based fungicide spray program with good sanitation practices to 
reduce losses from Phoma rot. Maintain good soil fertility, practice long crop rotations 
and control solanaceous weeds in and around fields cropped to tomato. Only harvest 
fruit after free moisture from rain or dew has dried from fruit surfaces and avoid 
injuring fruit during harvest. Do not pack fruit when wet.

Oidium lycopersici
DISTRIBUTION 
Leveillula taurica: Worldwide
Oidium neolycopersici: Worldwide
Oidium lycopersici: Australia, USA (California)
SYMPTOMS 
Leveillula taurica: Initial symptoms manifest as light-green to bright-yellow lesions 
on upper leaf surfaces. Eventually light, powdery fungal sporulation forms on lower 
leaf surfaces. Under ideal conditions, white, powdery masses of conidia develop on 
both leaf surfaces. As disease progresses, lesions turn necrotic; if disease is severe, 
entire leaves will die. Affected plants may defoliate, resulting in reduced yields and 
small, sunburned fruit.
Oidium neolycopersici and O. lycopersici: Disease first appears as small, circular 
areas of whitish fungal growth with sporulation occurring mainly on upper leaf surfaces. 
As sporulating lesions enlarge, underlying leaf tissue turns yellow, eventually 
becoming brown and shriveled. Sporulation that typically occurs on upper leaf surfaces 
distinguishes Oidium from Leveillula, which typically sporulates on lower leaf 
surfaces. When infection is severe, masses of powdery conidia will cover entire leaf 
surfaces, as well as petioles and calyces; however, fruit remain uninfected. Oidium 
neolycopersici has been reported in field-grown tomato but it is primarily an issue  
for protected culture production.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Leveillula taurica: This fungus has a wide host range on which it can survive and 
spread to tomatoes. Leveillula taurica conidia can travel long distances in air currents 
and can germinate under low (52-75%) relative humidity. Disease development is 
favored by warm (>27ºC) temperatures; however, L. taurica conidia can germinate 
between 10 and 32ºC.
Oidium neolycopersici and O. lycopersici: Optimum conditions for disease 
development include low light intensity and temperatures between 20 and 27ºC 
accompanied by high (85-95%) relative humidity. However, as with L. taurica, 
infection can occur at low (50%) relative humidity.
CONTROL 
Several fungicides, including sulfur, can be effective in controlling this disease if good 
coverage is obtained and they are applied in a timely manner. Inorganic bicarbonate 
slates and cupric hydroxide have also been effective in controlling powdery mildews.

CAUSAL AGENT 
Septoria lycopersici
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Symptoms first appear as small, dark, water-soaked spots on older leaves. Later, the 
spots enlarge to form circular lesions about five millimeters in diameter. These lesions 
have black or brown borders with gray centers that are peppered with small, black 
pycnidia. Lesions on stems, petioles and calyces tend to be elongated with pycnidia 
developing in centers of lesions. When Septoria leaf spot is severe, lesions coalesce, 
leaves collapse and eventually plants defoliate.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Septoria lycopersici can survive on debris from previous crops as well as on several 
weed hosts including nightshade, horse nettle, jimson weed and ground cherry. 
Extended periods of high (100%) relative humidity and temperatures between 20 and 
25°C favor infection and disease development. Numerous conidia are exuded from 
pycnidia when humidity is high. Conidia can then be spread by wind and splashing 
water from rain or overhead irrigation, and on workers’ clothing and tools, on 
cultivation equipment, and by insects.
CONTROL 
Establish a fungicide spray program in conjunction with cultural practices that lower 
inoculum potential such as turning under plant debris or plant debris removal. Rotate  
to a non-host crop for three years to reduce losses from Septoria leaf spot.

CAUSAL AGENT 
Sclerotium rolfsii  (teleomorph: Athelia rolfsii )
DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
This fungus can cause damping-off, crown and root rot, and fruit rot. The first symptom 
on seedlings is a dark-brown lesion at or below the soil line. Stem tissue is invaded 
completely, causing seedlings to quickly damp-off and die. On older plants, developing 
lesions girdle stems, causing plants to wilt without a change in foliage color. These 
lesions may continue expanding to cause root rot below the soil line and may also 
extend several centimeters above it. If moisture is adequate, white mycelium grows 
over lesion surfaces and tan sclerotia (one to two millimeters in diameter) are readily 
formed. Severely infected plants may eventually die. Fruit that contact Sclerotium rolfsii 
are invaded quickly, resulting in sunken, yellowish lesions with ruptured epidermises. 
White mycelium grows from fruit lesions and sclerotia form on lesion surfaces.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Sclerotium rolfsii is an efficient saprophyte and can survive in soil and plant debris for 
several years. This fungus can be spread in surface water and by the movement of 
infested soil on cultivation equipment. High (30-35°C) temperatures and soil moisture 
levels favor disease development.
CONTROL 
Regulate soil moisture levels and deep-plow plant residues to reduce losses from 
southern blight. Implement a sanitation program that includes removal or burning of 
all infected plants. Apply fungicides, fumigate soil and rotate from tomato to non-host 
crops like corn, grain sorghum and wheat for three years to reduce losses from 
southern blight.

Corynespora cassiicola
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
All above-ground parts of tomato plants can be infected by Corynespora cassiicola. 
Symptoms begin on leaves as tiny lesions that rapidly enlarge and develop into 
light-brown lesions with distinct yellow halos. Often, lesions grow together causing 
infected leaf tissue to collapse. Symptoms on stems also begin as small lesions that 
rapidly enlarge and elongate, and may eventually girdle stems, resulting in collapse of 
foliage above where stems were girdled. When disease is severe, numerous leaf and 
stem lesions form on plants causing extensive tissue collapse and eventually plant 
death. Infection of immature fruit begins as minute, dark-brown, sunken spots that 
enlarge as the disease progresses. Large, brown, circular lesions with cracked centers 
develop on mature fruit. Fungal sporulation commonly occurs from these lesions.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Corynespora cassiicola has a broad host range on which it survives. Infection  
occurs when temperatures are between 16 and 32°C during relatively long periods 
(>16 hours) of high moisture. Conidia, which form abundantly on surfaces of 
infected tissues, are spread by air movement and rainfall. 
CONTROL 
Initiate a fungicide spray program prior to the onset of symptoms to help reduce 
losses from target spot.

Verticillium albo-atrum
Verticillium dahliae
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Wilting of older leaves begins at leaflet margins which progress to yellow then brown 
v-shaped lesions. Older leaves eventually turn yellow and later, necrotic. Affected 
plants are stunted, do not respond to fertilizer or water, and display diurnal wilting 
on sunny days. When the base of the main stem is cut at the crown, a light-tan 
discoloration of vascular and pith tissues can be seen. This discoloration does not 
usually extend up the main stem to any extent, but can be present near the shoot 
tips when disease is severe.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
Verticillium albo-atrum and V. dahliae have extremely wide host ranges and can 
survive in plant debris as mycelia and microsclerotia for several years. Disease 
development is favored by moderate (21-25°C) temperatures. These fungi enter 
plants through root wounds caused by cultivation, secondary root formation and 
nematode feeding.
CONTROL 
Grow resistant varieties to reduce losses from Verticillium wilt. Soil fumigation and 
solarization have been shown to reduce disease incidence.

Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
Sclerotinia minor
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS 
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and S. minor can infect leaves, stems, petioles and occasionally 
fruit. Initially, water-soaked lesions develop on stems, eventually causing a softening 
of infected areas. Typically, white mycelium grows on stem lesions. A progressive soft 
decay of external tissues is followed by an internal hollowing of pith tissue. Large 
areas of affected stems eventually die and become dry and tan-gray. Irregularly shaped 
black pebble-like bodies called sclerotia develop on surfaces of and inside stems and 
are diagnostic for this disease. Infected fruit develop grayish lesions that quickly turn 
into a watery rot with white mycelium and sclerotia developing on lesion surfaces.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT 
These fungi have a wide host range and can survive as sclerotia in soil and in infested 
plant debris from one season to the next. Sclerotia are the main source of inoculum 
for this disease. Conditions of prolonged moisture from high humidity, frequent rains, 
dews and fog, and cool temperatures (16-21°C) favor disease development. The most 
important means of long-distance spread is airborne ascospores that erupt from sclerotia. 
Moving contaminated soil and fertilizing with manure from animals fed infected plant 
debris are two common ways of short distance spread of sclerotia and mycelium. 
Irrigation water may also spread these fungi within fields and from field to field.
CONTROL 
Avoid fields where white mold losses have occurred previously. Plant in well-drained 
soil, use wide row spacing and water very early in the day. Remove all plant debris 
from previous crops. Manure and plant mulches suspected to come from infected 
locations should not be used unless sterilized. Establish a crop rotation with non-host 
crops such as corn, small grains and grasses. Fumigate or steam-sterilize soil to reduce 
soilborne inoculum, and apply fungicides to further reduce losses from white mold.

Meloidogyne chitwoodi  (Root-knot nematode)
Meloidogyne enterolobbii  (Root-knot nematode)
DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
The first above-ground symptoms are stunting, wilting and a general off-color 
appearance of affected plants. Other symptoms include chlorosis and characteristic 
symptoms of nutrient deficiency (e.g., abaxial leaf surfaces turn purple, which can 
indicate phosphorous deficiency). When diseased plants are pulled-up, irregular swellings 
of the roots, referred to as galls or knots, are easily observed. Southern root-knot 
nematode galls tend to be larger and more irregular in shape and size compared to 
those caused by the northern root-knot nematode, which produces smaller, discrete 
and more uniform galls with lateral roots developing adjacent to the galls.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Root-knot nematodes have a very wide host range that encompasses many agricultural 
crops as well as weeds on which they can grow and survive. Disease is more severe 
in areas where there is a long growing season with a mild or no winter season. 
Although these nematodes can cause disease in many soil types, root damage is 
most serious on light, sandy soils. Warm (27°C) soil temperatures favor disease 
development by M. arenaria, M. javanica, and M. incognita whereas cool (16-20°C) 
soil temperatures favor disease development by M. hapla. Meloidogyne incognita  
is by far the most widely distributed root-knot nematode species worldwide.
CONTROL
The use of resistant varieties is the most effective way to control Meloidogyne 
species. The most common resistance gene used in tomato is designated Mi. The 
Mi gene confers resistance against M. arenaria, M. incognita and M. javanica but 
it is not effective against M. hapla and some of the other Meloidogyne species, 
which highlights the importance of correct identification of the Meloidogyne species 
present in a region or field. Tomato varieties carrying the Mi gene should be managed 
with cultural practices that reduce nematode populations because continued use of 
resistant varieties alone will result in selection of nematodes that overcome resistance 
conferred by the Mi gene. Mi resistance can be broken when soil temperatures reach 
27-33°C for prolonged periods of time. Additional root-knot control measures include 
crop rotation with cover crops (e.g., sun hemp, Crotalaria juncea; hairy indigo, 
Indigofera hirsuta) that are poor hosts of root-knot nematodes and which return 
high amounts of nitrogen and organic matter to soil. Crop rotation with small grains 
may help in some tomato-growing regions where nematodes are problematic. Crop 
rotation to Brassica species in combination with soil solarization has shown some 
effectiveness in controlling root-knot nematodes. Soil pasteurization and fumigation 
as well as transplanting disease-free seedlings can also help reduce losses from 
root-knot nematodes.

DISTRIBUTION 
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
Belonolaimus species (Sting nematode): Roots of affected plants are short 
and stubby with dark lesions at root tips. The entire root system is reduced in 
size compared to a healthy root system. When damage to root tips is severe, new 
roots may form above Belonolaimus-infected roots, which gives a highly branched 
appearance to the root system. Foliage of affected plants may turn yellow or red, 
indicating a nutrient deficiency or a physiological response to nematode feeding.
Globodera species (Potato cyst nematode): The host range of the potato 
cyst nematode is relatively small (potato, tomato and eggplant). Reddish-brown 
necrotic lesions with brown to whitish-gray cysts, which are egg-containing female 
nematodes, develop on roots. Later, roots of affected plants may decay from root rot. 
Globodera-infected plants may display uneven growth and be tall and sparse with 
decreased fruit production. Lower leaves eventually turn a pale yellow.
Pratylenchus species (Root lesion nematode): Root infections do not usually 
cause economic damage. However, lesions that develop on roots can often be 
invaded by soilborne fungal and bacterial pathogens. Infected, asymptomatic plants 
can serve as a reservoir, allowing nematodes to reproduce and increase populations.
Rotylenchus species (Reniform nematode): Above-ground symptoms on tomato 
include stunting and defoliation. Rotylenchus-infected roots may be discolored and 
necrotic, and develop areas of decay. Affected plants yield less compared to healthy 
plants due to impaired root systems. Plant death can occur if nematode populations 
are high.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
These nematodes are commonly associated with high sand-content soils and thrive 
under warm, irrigated conditions. These nematodes all can survive on several weed 
species which can act as asymptomatic reservoirs of nematode populations.
CONTROL
Proper identification of the nematode species present in a field and its population 
is critical for determining effective management strategies. Decrease nematode 
populations with nematicides and weed-free fallow periods. Grow cover crops like 
sun hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and hairy indigo (Indigofera hirsuta) that are poor 
nematode hosts but which return high amounts of nitrogen and organic matter to 
soils. Implement cultural practices that promote moisture and nutrient availability 
throughout the crop cycle.

SYMPTOMS
The first noticeable sign of broomrape is appearance of whitish-yellow shoots at the 
base of infected tomato plants. When soil is removed, broomrape roots are found to 
be attached to roots of affected plants. Later these yellow snapdragon-like parasitic 
plants produce flowers, and as broomrape plants mature they turn brown and their 
seed capsules release tiny, black seeds.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Broomrape seeds may lie dormant in soil for more than 20 years. Root exudates from 
host plants stimulate germination and young broomrape seedlings attach their roots 
to roots of host plants from which they extract nutrients to grow and reproduce. After 
flowering, very small seeds are produced that can be distributed within and between 
fields as soil is cultivated, on cultivation equipment and in irrigation water. Conditions 
favorable for tomato plant growth also favor broomrape growth and parasitism. 
CONTROL
Fumigation and crop rotation can reduce losses from Orobanche species when used 
in conjunction with good sanitation practices that include removing and destroying all 
affected tomato plants along with parasitic broomrape plants.

DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
More than one hundred species of Cuscuta occur worldwide. Dodder is an annual 
parasitic plant that can be identified by slender, white, yellow or red, leafless strands 
that twine around the host plant. Dodder has no chlorophyll and depends solely on 
the host plant for its nutrition. Infected plants will appear weak and discolored. Growth 
and yield can be significantly reduced. Under heavy dodder infestations small host 
plants may die. As the season progresses, dodder grows down a row to cover plants 
with a mass of vines. Heavily infested fields appear yellow.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Generally, dodder has a very wide host range and is adapted to a wide range of 
environments. After germination, the seedling depends on nutrients stored for its 
survival. If a suitable host is not found within a few days, it will die. Once a seedling 
contacts a host it forms sucker-like projections (haustoria) that penetrate plant 
tissues. Dodder produces small, inconspicuous flowers (often white) that mature and 
produce two to four yellow to black seeds.
Irrigation water and cultivation equipment are common modes of long distance 
dispersal. Dodder seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for up to ten 
years. Seeds usually germinate in late winter and spring in cold climates; however, 
germination can continue through the summer. Environmental conditions that favor 
tomato growth are also beneficial to dodder.
CONTROL
Immediately remove or burn dodder, along with infested plants upon detection. Apply 
contact herbicides to control localized infestations. If an infestation is widespread, 
apply pre-emergence herbicides, deep-plow crop debris, and rotate to grasses.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Phytoplasmas, formerly known as mycoplasma-like organisms, are pleomorphic, 
obligate bacteria that lack cell walls. They live and move within plants through 
phloem vessels. Several phytoplasma diseases have been associated with tomato 
under various names (stolber, tomato big bud, tomato yellows). The primary symptom 
of tomato big bud, and the one for which it is named, is enlargement and abnormal 
development of flower buds. Sepals may not separate as flowers open, and buds 
are swollen and green. Other symptoms include a thickening of stems, proliferation 
of small side shoots and aerial root initials. Shortening of the internodes, an erect 
growth habit and development of an overall yellowish appearance may also occur. 
Fruit may be small and deformed.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
This phytoplasma can survive in crops such as hot pepper, lettuce, eggplant and 
potato, as well as weeds such as dock, lambsquarter, nightshade, sowthistle and 
jimson weed, and is readily transmitted to tomato by the common brown leafhopper. 
Transmission occurs when leafhoppers carrying the phytoplasma migrate to tomato 
and feed.
CONTROL
Eradicate solanaceous weeds that harbor the vector and spray insecticides to reduce 
leafhopper populations to control the spread of this disease. Rogue symptomatic 
plants as soon as they are detected to reduce secondary spread of this disease.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Typically, first symptoms appear as yellowing or bronzing of young leaflets as well  
as necrosis of leaflet veins. Severely affected plants stop growing and leaflets curl 
downward. The main stem has a dark-brown discoloration of the phloem at the 
soil line which can be seen by lightly scraping the epidermis from the stem. This 
discoloration may extend into the upper shoot tips. Irregular, brown streaking in the 
stem pith is characteristic of alfalfa mosaic. Roots often show this same red-brown 
discoloration. Depending on the age of the plant at the time of infection, fruit may 
develop external and internal brown spots and may be distorted. Generally, disease 
incidence is greater the closer tomatoes are to alfalfa fields and gradually diminishes 
with increasing distance from the source.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
AMV has a wide host range on which it can survive and is typically found in older  
alfalfa fields or permanent pastures. Aphids carry AMV in a non-persistent manner 
and transmission occurs during feeding or probing of plants. During hay-mowing, 
winged aphids carry the virus from alfalfa to nearby tomato fields. Little or no  
secondary spread occurs within a field.
CONTROL
Locating fields away or upwind from alfalfa are possible means of avoiding alfalfa 
mosaic. Spraying for aphids will not eliminate primary infection of tomatoes.

magnesium or nitrogen deficiency or even pesticide phytotoxicity. First symptoms 
express approximately three to four weeks after initial infection and include 
development of interveinal chlorotic blotches on older leaves while the leaf veins 
remain green. As symptoms progress to younger leaves, the chlorotic blotches turn 
bleached-white or necrotic depending on the variety, and affected leaf tissues 
become brittle. Fruit color may be impacted. Severe losses due to poor fruit set  
have been reported. 
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Several species of whitefly transmit these two viruses in a semi-persistent manner 
in protected culture. These viruses are not seedborne nor can they be transmitted 
mechanically. Once acquired by the whitefly, the virus remains infectious in the insect’s 
body for a few days. Virus spread only occurs when virus-carrying whiteflies move 
from infected to healthy plants. Early infection can result in severe yield loss in certain 
varieties.
CONTROL 
Management of these viruses can be very challenging due to high populations of 
vectors, high vector efficiencies transmitting the viruses and the wide host range of 
vectors and viruses. Chemical and cultural practices have been the primary methods 
used to control these viruses. Although insecticides can reduce whitefly populations, 
this method of control was shown to be inefficient because whiteflies still transmit 
TICV and ToCV before dying from exposure to an insecticide. Also, in the time it takes 
for symptoms of infection to express (three to four weeks), the viruses can be spread 
extensively before symptoms are observed. Use insect exclusion screening (50 mesh/ 
297 micron) on all protected-culture structures to minimize entrance of whiteflies into 
greenhouses. Obtain all transplants from a whitefly-free nursery. Remove all plant 
material from greenhouses after crop completion and implement a plant-free period  
to ensure the absence of whiteflies in greenhouses.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of this disease vary greatly depending on the virus strain. Often CMV 
stunts tomato plants to give affected plants a bushy appearance. Leaf symptoms may 
vary from mild, green mottling to chlorosis or severe necrosis. Some CMV strains 
cause a severe “shoestring” symptom in which leaflet blades are tapered or even 
greatly reduced with only the midrib of the leaflet remaining. “Shoestring” symptoms 
can be confused with the severe symptoms observed with ToMV infection; however, 
with the CMV-caused shoestring symptoms, the blade of the leaflet is usually more 
suppressed. Fruit are reduced in size and often misshapen.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
This virus has a wide host range (800 species) from which it can be acquired by 
aphids and transmitted in a non-persistent manner. CMV is mainly a problem where 
infected alternate hosts survive all year long as well as in greenhouses where, once 
introduced, it can be spread readily from plant to plant by aphids. CMV can also 
be mechanically transmitted; however, because the virus particle is unstable, the 
likelihood of transmission by greenhouse workers and their tools is much less than 
with a virus like ToMV.
CONTROL
In greenhouse crops controlling aphids can greatly reduce the incidence of this disease. 
In field-grown tomato, eliminate weeds and ornamental plants that harbor the virus.

VECTOR DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide 
SYMPTOMS
Plants infected when young can be bushy and stunted with shortened internodes  
and erect branches. Leaflets are often small, chlorotic, cupped upward and have  
a leathery texture. Other characteristic begomovirus symptoms include leaf rolling, 
interveinal chlorosis of new leaves and purpling of older leaves. Severely affected 
plants generally do not set fruit. Plants infected later tend to develop less severe 
symptoms, but also include leaf chlorosis, cupping, flower abortion and failure to set 
fruit. Fruit that have set before infection often ripen normally, but fruit number can  
be dramatically reduced. 
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Begomoviruses have a relatively wide host range which includes cereals, legumes, 
vegetables, fiber crops (cotton) and weeds. Begomoviruses are transmitted in a 
circulative persistent manner by whiteflies in both temperate and tropical regions of 
the world. Approximately 15-30 minutes of whitefly feeding can result in transmission 
of the virus. Mechanical transmission of begomoviruses has only been observed in 
a few strains. Severe outbreaks are associated with large populations of whiteflies. 
Older abandoned tomato fields can remain an important source of the virus. Although 
resistant varieties are available and produce acceptable yields, they can still act as  
a reservoir to infect newly planted susceptible varieties.
CONTROL
The use of resistant varieties can greatly reduce losses from begomoviruses. 
Host-free periods have been shown to be an effective measure for controlling the 
whitefly vector. Insecticide spray programs have been largely ineffective. Control 
weeds, incorporate crop debris immediately after harvest and avoid planting near 
infected solanum crops. In protected culture, the use of a 50+ mesh/297-micron 
screen is recommended to exclude whiteflies and aphids. The use of fans at the 
entrances along with a comprehensive hygiene program can aid in minimizing  
insect entry.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Typically, infected plants are erect and stunted; severely infected seedlings may die. 
Leaves thicken with their margins rolling upward as petioles curl downward. Later, 
leaves turn a dull-yellow with an accompanying purpling of leaflet veins. Very few fruit 
are produced and those that set before infection ripen prematurely. Fruit affected by 
this disease are dull, small and wrinkled with a dried appearance.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
This virus has a wide host range of 300 species from which it can be transmitted in a 
persistent manner only by beet leafhoppers. Sugar beet is a common host for both the 
virus and leafhoppers. Virus-carrying leafhoppers can be moved by wind into adjacent 
tomato fields and can also migrate from their overwintering weedy hosts to tomato 
fields in the spring. Patterns of infection in the field indicate a “raining” of virus-carrying 
leafhoppers. Little or no secondary spread occurs within tomato fields. Other common 
hosts for this virus are watermelon, cantaloupe, squash, pepper, spinach and beans.
CONTROL
Spray insecticides on weeds to control leafhoppers and avoid growing on land near 
beet fields and range land to reduce losses from beet curly top. Spraying tomato 
fields for leafhoppers will not control beet curly top. In areas where BCTV is present, 
transplant double rows of processing tomatoes to allow more individual plants to 
escape infection.

SYMPTOMS
PMoV symptoms include mosaic or mottling of leaves, developing on to apical 
necrosis and dieback. Fruit develop chlorotic rings, which later become necrotic 
leading to fruit deformation. ToNSV and TomNSV symptoms are almost identical to 
one another and can be easily confused with the ilarvirus type species, Tobacco 
streak virus. Foliar symptoms of ToNSV and TomNSV infection include necrotic spots 
that tend to initiate at the base of leaflets and develop progressively outward. Infected 
upper foliage tends to twist and curl, and dieback of petioles and stems often occurs 
in severely infected plants.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Little is known about the biology of ilarviruses because inoculum sources remain 
unknown. The host range for these viruses is not completely understood but it is 
known that PMoV infects two weed species: Parietaria pensylvanica and P. officinalis. 
Low levels of ToNSV infection have been found in pepper, onion and Solanum nigrum 
(black nightshade). Thrips and pollen are suspected to be involved in Tomato necrotic 
streak virus transmission, similar to other ilarviruses including Tomato necrotic spot 
virus and Tobacco streak virus. Mechanical transmission of PMoV and ToNSV also 
occurs quite readily. 
CONTROL
Control of ilarviruses is challenging because the epidemiology of the diseases they 
cause is not well understood. Implement an IPM program including weed and insect 
control to manage ilarviruses.

Pelargonium zonate spot virus (PZSV) 
VECTOR
Mechanically transmitted
DISTRIBUTION 
France, Israel, Italy, Spain, USA (California)
SYMPTOMS
PZSV belongs to the family Bromoviridae (genus Anulavirus) and was originally 
recovered from Pelargonium zonale, but in the 1980s PZSV was found to be the 
causal agent of a disease in tomato. On tomato, symptoms of PZSV on leaves, stem 
and fruits are characterized by line patterns, and chlorotic and necrotic rings, together 
with plant stunting, leaf malformation and poor fruit set. Moreover, infected tomato 
plants exhibit stem necrosis, which may often result in plant death. PZSV symptoms 
are highly dependent on environmental conditions such as light intensity, temperature, 
and host species and are often weak under greenhouse conditions.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
In addition to tomato, natural infections of PZSV have been observed in artichoke 
(Cynara cardunculus), capsicum (Capsicum annuum), kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), 
Chrysanthemum coronarium, and weeds (e.g., Capsella bursa-pastoris, Diplotaxis 
erucoides, Picris echoides, Sonchus oleaceus ). Host range was essentially similar 
between different PZSV isolates (Cucumis sativus, Solanum melongena, Datura 
stramonium, Nicotiana benthamiana, N. glutinosa and N. tabacum) with the major 
differences being (i) isolates from Israel, France and California infect N. benthamiana 
whereas the Italian isolate does not, (ii) isolates from Israel, Spain and France all 
infect D. stramonium whereas the Italian isolate does not and (iii) reactions on 
cucumber plants to PZSV were not clear. PZSV can also be transmitted by grafting. 
Recent studies showed that PZSV is also transmitted vertically via both infected 
tomato seeds (virus not on seed surface) and pollen. It has been suggested that 
thrips could transport infected pollen grains and contribute to disease spread. 
CONTROL
For the highly contagious, mechanically transmitted PZSV, control depends largely 
on a thorough sanitation program for workers, plant debris, tools, equipment and 
facilities because resistant cultivars are not yet available. The use of non-fat dry 
milk (3.5% protein) or a 20% bleach solution is effective for sanitizing tools for other 
mechanically transmitted viruses. Clearly, pollen and seed transmission of PZSV is of 
major concern for the tomato industry. PZSV transmission rate from seed to seedling 
was 11-29%, regardless of the seed-disinfection treatment. Thus, even low rates of 
viral seed transmission can facilitate the introduction of PZSV into new geographical 
areas. It is important to eradicate symptomatic plants and produce tomato hybrids in 
tomato production areas that are free of PZSV.

Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV)
VECTOR 
Mechanically transmitted
DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide 
SYMPTOMS
Initially, this virus was confused with another Potexvirus, potato virus X (PVX), due 
to similar symptoms observed. PepMV symptoms are influenced by variety, age of 
plant and environment. Generally, symptoms are most easily recognized near the 
plant apex. The upper portions of the plant may become less dense and vigorous, 
developing a grayish cast. Affected foliage may bend downward and curl toward the 
stem. Emerging leaves may be distorted and needle-like. One or many small yellow 
leaf spots can also develop throughout the plant. These spots may enlarge while 
retaining their distinct margins. The entire plant may appear to turn yellow as disease 
progresses. If blistering on the leaves occurs, it appears slightly darker than the 
surrounding tissue. Mottling of varying degrees of severity can occur on ripening and 
mature fruit. Symptoms can initially remain restricted to a single tomato cluster, but 
eventually more clusters will show this abnormal coloring or marbling of the fruit.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
PepMV has a relatively narrow host range which does not include pepper. It is highly 
contagious via mechanical transmission. Disease expression is enhanced under low 
light conditions and during periods of slow plant growth. Under more favorable growing 
conditions infected plants can remain symptomless or the severity of visible symptoms 
may decrease. Regardless of the appearance of plants, PepMV cannot be eradicated 
from plants once they are infected. PepMV is easily transmitted by contact between 
healthy plants and contaminated hands, clothing, tools, equipment and trays. 
Bumblebees may possibly transmit PepMV indirectly during flower visits. PepMV can 
remain infective in plant debris that are not properly decomposed but the virus does not 
remain infective in soil. Irrigation water can be a source of PepMV in a protected culture 
environment if not properly treated with ultraviolet light.
CONTROL
Plant resistance is currently not an option in tomato. The best management to minimize 
infection by this disease is to implement a strict sanitation and hygiene program for 
plant debris, workers, tools, equipment and facilities. The use of non-fat dry milk 
(3.5% protein) or bleach (20%) solution effectively prevents transmission from tools, 
and non-fat dry milk is a safe and effective treatment for workers’ hands. Many seed 
and fruit production companies implement policies that do not allow workers to bring 
fresh solanum fruit to their facilities because the fruit could be contaminated with 
PepMV and other pathogens. The virus can be seed-transmitted, albeit at very low 
rates, but all seed producers and commercial growers should start with clean seed.
In recent years, many tomato-growing companies across Europe are implementing 
a cross protection strategy against PepMV. The basis of this strategy is also known 
as an acquired immunity phenomenon, where a mild virus isolate/strain can protect 
plants against economic damage caused by a severe challenge strain/isolate of the 
same virus.

DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
Disease symptoms reported on tomato range from a mild mottling and slight distortion 
of leaves to a severe mottling and crinkling of leaves. Overall, plants infected with 
potyviruses tend to have a bushy appearance and be lighter in color than healthy plants. 
Fruit are often reduced in size, and may be mottled and misshapen. Internally, fruit may 
develop necrosis which is commonly associated with irregular ripening. In general, the 
earlier a plant is infected, the greater the negative effect on growth and yield.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Many species of weeds are hosts of potyviruses, which can be transmitted by at least 
ten species of aphids. Both PVY and TEV are transmitted in a non-persistent manner 
by virus-carrying aphids that move into tomato fields from nearby solanaceous 
weeds, peppers and other tomato fields that are already infected. Virus spread is 
often rapid and localized. Secondary infection may occur with aphids, or these viruses 
may be mechanically transmitted through staking, pruning and handling of infected 
plants. It is common to find plants infected with more than one potyvirus. CMV has 
also been associated with potyvirus infections.
CONTROL
Remove weed hosts which may harbor potyviruses. Avoid locating tomato productions 
near pepper crops because peppers can be a major source of potyviruses. Reducing the 
spread of the disease by controlling aphid population is very difficult and generally not 
practical. The use of silver plastic mulches may delay infection by potyviruses by repelling 
aphids that transmit these viruses during early plant development. The effectiveness of 
silver mulches decreases when more than 60% of the mulch is covered by foliage.

SYMPTOMS
Foliar mosaic is a characteristic symptom of tobamovirus infection. Leaf symptoms  
can also include chlorotic mottling, upward leaf rolling, malformation, reduced leaf 
size and necrosis. Symptom development depends on virus strain, cultivar, age at 
infection, temperature and light. Early infection often stunts plants. Under cool 
conditions, emerging leaves may exhibit a shoestring or “fernleaf” appearance. During 
high temperatures and under high light conditions, foliar symptoms may be masked, 
especially in field production. Fruit can occasionally ripen unevenly and exhibit internal 
browning of the fruit wall, known as brown wall. Brown wall typically occurs on the 
first two fruit clusters several days prior to foliar symptoms. Some varieties with 
heterozygous resistance to ToMV will show necrotic streaks or spots on stems, 
petioles, fruit and foliage. ToMV is the most prevalent tobamovirus infecting tomato.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Tobamoviruses that infect tomato have a wide host range that includes many 
agricultural crops and weeds, all of which can serve as inoculum sources. These 
viruses are readily transmitted mechanically by workers, tools and equipment 
during plant handling and are considered some of the most stable and infectious 
viruses known. Infested debris from a previous crop can be a source of inoculum in 
subsequent crops. Chewing insects can spread these viruses but are not considered 
a major source of infection. Tobamoviruses can be seedborne in tomato but infection 
and spread most likely occur when seedlings are thinned in the nursery  
or transplanted.
CONTROL
Planting resistant varieties is generally the best control strategy, although strains 
capable of overcoming resistance have been reported and new tobamoviruses 
(e.g., TBRFV) can also overcome deployed resistance genes. Avoid fields where 
the previous crop was infected. Implement a comprehensive crop inspection and 
hygiene program, including tool and equipment sanitation, worker hand-washing 
and protective clothing. In protected culture, use non-fat dry milk (3.5% protein) and 
chemical disinfectants during plant handling, pruning and leaf removal. Use hard 
plastic trays, which can be cleaned and sanitized more effectively than Styrofoam.  
Do not reuse growing media.

TOMATO BUSHY STUNT 
CAUSAL AGENT
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV)
VECTOR
Mechanically transmitted
DISTRIBUTION
Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, 
Spain, Tunisia, USA (California)
SYMPTOMS
Initial symptoms may vary from irregular light banding patterns on leaves to necrotic 
lesions or rings. Leaves soon turn from green to pale-yellow, sometimes with 
interspersed green patches. Eventually affected leaves may drop from the plant. New 
leaves frequently are twisted and have necrotic tips. An abundance of side shoots 
develops, giving affected plants a bushy, stunted appearance. As disease progresses, 
lower leaves turn chlorotic and purple. Infected seedlings that receive too much 
fertilizer may develop lesions on the epicotyl at the soil line, resulting in girdling and 
seedling death. Fruit symptoms can vary from chlorotic blotches to rings or line patterns.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
TBSV is a very stable virus with a very diverse natural host range. This virus is 
soilborne and readily transmissible in water. A natural vector of TBSV is currently 
unknown but it is believed that TBSV infects plants through wounds in the roots. TBSV 
has been found in river water so it is possible that it is spread in irrigation water.
CONTROL
Avoid planting in soils known to contain TBSV. This virus is difficult to control once  
it is present in a soil.

TOMATO DOUBLE-VIRUS STREAK 
SYNONYM = DOUBLE STREAK
CAUSAL AGENTS
Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) 
Potato virus X (PVX)
VECTOR
Mechanically transmitted
DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
Symptoms occur on young leaves as small, brown spots and on petioles and stems  
as narrow dark-brown streaks. Lesions may coalesce to form large, dead areas and 
leaves that curl downward. Lesions on the fruit are small and only skin deep but may 
run together, forming large lesions. These lesions give a greasy appearance to the fruit 
which eventually may become rough and misshapen.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
ToMV and PVX are individually easily mechanically transmitted by greenhouse 
workers, their tools and on cultivation equipment; however, for this disease to occur 
both viruses must be present in the same plant. If young plants already infected with 
ToMV become infected with PVX, double streak occurs. Symptom severity is affected 
by virus strain, plant age and day length.
CONTROL
Grow ToMV-resistant varieties, rogue infected plants and avoid handling potatoes 
prior to working with tomatoes to reduce losses from double streak. Also, do not 
plant in fields that were planted to potatoes the previous season, and sterilize tools 
immediately after handling infected plants to reduce spread and disease incidence.

DISTRIBUTION
ToANV (ToMarV): Mexico
ToCSV: Guatemala
ToTV: Australia, Central America, Europe, South Africa
ToNDV: USA (California)
SYMPTOMS
Necrotic lesions initially appear at the base of leaflets and later expand to cover 
petioles, leaves and stems. The shoot apex may eventually become necrotic, resulting 
in dieback. Other symptoms may include mild leaf mottling and stunting of the plant. 
Foliar symptoms caused by Torradoviruses can be easily confused with symptoms 
caused by tomato spotted wilt virus. Fruit may develop a necrotic, corky ring pattern 
and be deformed.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Torradovirus host range appears to be limited to Solanaceae. ToTV has been shown 
to infect several weed species, sometimes asymptomatically. In addition to whitefly 
transmission, torradoviruses can be mechanically transmitted at a very low rate. There 
is no evidence that these viruses are seed-transmitted.
CONTROL
Resistance to ToANV (ToMarV) exists in indeterminate tomato types whereas no 
resistance is known in determinate (e.g., processing) tomato varieties, which appear 
to be extremely susceptible. Ensure transplants are free of disease. A host-free period 
of two to three months will reduce whitefly populations leading to a decrease in virus 
incidence. Implement an insecticide program, weed control and a comprehensive 
sanitation program. In protected culture (e.g., transplant operations, commercial 
production) facilities utilize a screen size of 50-mesh (297-microns) to reduce  
whitefly entry.

TOSPOVIRUS DISEASES
VECTORS
Frankliniella occidentalis (western flower thrips)
Thrips tabaci (onion thrips)
Several additional thrips species
SYMPTOMS
Symptoms tend to be more severe on plants infected when young. Symptom 
expression can also vary with variety. Plants infected when young may exhibit stunting 
and inward cupping of leaves that develop a bronze cast followed by dark spots. 
Other characteristic tospovirus symptoms include mottling, chlorotic and necrotic leaf 
spots, which often lead to chlorosis and necrosis of entire leaves. Concentric ring 
spots are also a characteristic tospovirus symptom. Tospovirus symptoms can manifest 
as necrosis of growing tips, leading to bud necrosis. On fruit, symptoms can manifest 
as concentric rings that become necrotic.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
TSWV has a wide host range, whereas the host range of most other tospovirus species 
is more limited. Tospoviruses are transmitted in a persistent manner by several thrips 
species. Larvae acquire the virus after short feeding periods, and adult thrips transmit 
these viruses for the duration of their lives. The presence of infected weeds or mature 
plants in adjacent fields can pose a threat to newly planted crops. Temperatures above 
22°C accelerate the hatching of eggs, resulting in explosive spread of these vectors 
and viruses. Tospoviruses are not seed-transmitted.
CONTROL
Use virus-free transplants. In protected culture (transplant operations, commercial 
production) facilities utilize a minimum screen size of 72-mesh (192-microns) and 
implement a comprehensive hygiene program to minimize tospovirus infection by 
excluding thrips. Monitor thrips populations during the growing season to determine 
when insecticide applications are necessary. Rogue infected plants and control weeds 
that serve as reservoirs for viruses and vectors in and around all crops. Biological 
control agents have also been successfully implemented in protected culture. Avoid 
planting downwind of ornamental or older crops, which can serve as reservoirs for 
thrips and tospovirus. Tospovirus resistance is currently available for TSWV in tomato.

COMMON VECTORS OF TOMATO VIRUSES
Aphids, whiteflies, thrips and leafhoppers are among the more common vectors 
of viruses that cause severe damage in tomato. The mode of transmission can 
be unique to each virus and vector combination. Transmission ranges from non-
persistent or passive transport of viral particles on external mouth parts to the more 
complex internal virus-vector relationships characteristic of persistent movement. In 
non-persistent movement, virus particles are acquired during feeding or probing of 
infected plants and carried on mouth parts to the next feeding site. Virus acquisition 
takes place within seconds and transmissibility lasts several hours to a day. Longer 
acquisition and inoculation periods characterize persistent transmission. The virus is 
acquired during feeding, but before transmission can occur, the particles must move 
through the digestive system and into the salivary glands. New infections occur during 
feeding when viruliferous vectors inject viable virus particles with saliva into the plant 
cells or vascular tissues of healthy plants. In general, once they become infective, 
persistent vectors can transmit viruses for the duration of their adult lives.
Aphids: Aphids are small, pear-shaped, gregarious insects. They can lay eggs and, 
in warm climates, produce live offspring without mating. Aphids can travel from leaf to 
leaf and plant to plant as wingless nymphs and as winged or wingless adults. Aphids 
usually invade fields as winged adults. Once established, aphids can be found on the 
growing points and on the underside of newer leaves.
Aphids can cause significant damage to tomato, causing spotting and chlorosis of 
leaves, leaf curling and distortion and abscission of flowers. The fungi that cause 
a sooty mold can grow on the sugary honeydew excreted by aphids, reducing fruit 
quality. Two common aphid pests of tomato are the potato aphid (Macrosiphum 
euphorbiae), which is large (3 mm) and colored pink or green, and the green peach 
aphid (Myzus persicae), which is smaller (1.5 mm) and colored light to dark green.
The number and diversity of viruses vectored by aphids far exceed those moved 
around by other vectors. Aphids transmit viruses in both a persistent and non-
persistent manner. There is no evidence to suggest the viruses are carried to the 
next generation via eggs. The viruses carried passively by aphids to tomato can 
be acquired and transmitted within seconds and include Cucumber mosaic virus, 
Tobacco etch virus, and Alfalfa mosaic virus. Viruses persistently transmitted by 
aphids include Potato leaf roll virus and Beet western yellows virus, neither of  
which is a major problem in tomato.
Whiteflies: The greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and sweet potato 
whitefly or silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci; synonym = B. argentifolii ) are serious 
insect pests worldwide. B. tabaci represents a complex of over 35 cryptic species 
[e.g., Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1: formerly termed B biotype), Mediterranean 
(MED: formerly termed Q biotype)] and has emerged as an invasive pest to spread 
viruses worldwide. Over 500 plant species including weeds, vegetable, ornamental 
and agronomic crops are attacked. Immature and adult whiteflies colonize the 
underside of leaves. The larval stages are sedentary, whereas the tiny (1 mm) adults 
fly short distances from leaf to leaf or plant to plant, or are carried for miles by wind. 
Once established, populations build up rapidly due to a life cycle of 20 days or less 
in dry, warm climates. Rain and cold weather reduce whitefly populations. Whiteflies 
feed on phloem and produce sugary honeydew on leaves and fruit. Sooty mold fungi 
colonize the honeydew, reducing fruit quality and yield. Whitefly infestations can also 
slow plant growth and cause stunting and defoliation.

V I R A L
COMMON VECTORS OF TOMATO VIRUSES
The viruses transmitted by whiteflies are very important in tropical and subtropical 
regions, but are not confined to these areas. In tomato, B. tabaci is an important 
vector of begomoviruses such as Tomato yellow leaf curl, Tomato mottle virus, and the 
numerous begomoviruses found throughout Mexico, and Central and South America. 
T. vaporariorum was shown to transmit Tomato infectious chlorosis virus, a new 
disease in California tomato production regions. These viruses are carried persistently 
or semi-persistently. There is no evidence to suggest that these viruses are passed to 
the offspring of infected adult whiteflies.
Thrips: Five species of thrips are commonly found on tomato. The western 
flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) is native to the western USA, but has been 
introduced into many regions worldwide. The flower thrips (F. tritici), the tobacco 
thrips (F. fusca) and the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) as well as the western flower 
thrips mainly feed on flowers and small fruit. The greenhouse thrips (Heliothrips 
haemorrhoidalis) is found in greenhouses worldwide where it causes damage to a 
wide range of ornamental and vegetable plant species. On tomato, the greenhouse 
thrips mainly feeds on foliage. Generally, thrips reproduce without mating. The 
larvae are relatively inactive, but the tiny adults (<0.5 mm) are winged and mobile. 
Adults live up to 20 days and populations can increase quickly. Egg deposition 
and subsequent feeding by larvae causes discoloration, spotting and scarring in 
developing fruit.
Several species of thrips transmit tospoviruses. Thrips larvae acquire tospoviruses 
after short feeding periods and transmit these viruses primarily as adults. Occasionally 
transmission occurs in nymphs. These viruses are not passed to the next generation; 
however, there is some evidence to support replication in the vector. The western 
flower thrips and the onion thrips are the major vectors of Tomato spotted wilt virus. 
Thrips can also spread pollen-transmitted viruses while feeding and have been 
implicated in the spread of Tomato double virus streak.
Leafhoppers: Leafhoppers are found in warm, dry regions worldwide. They are 
wedge-shaped, green to greenish-yellow to brown and up to 3 mm long. Nymphs 
are similar in shape to adults except they lack fully developed wings. Leafhoppers 
have a very wide host range, including numerous weeds and vegetables. Leafhoppers 
feed on phloem tissues leaving pale, circular spots or peppery specks in leaves. 
Adult females make hatch cuts across leaf veins and stems to insert eggs. Their life 
cycle can be completed in 40 to 45 days under favorable environmental conditions. 
In California, leafhoppers overwinter in weeds, especially those in the foothills of the 
Sierra Nevada and Coast mountain ranges. In spring, as weeds die, leafhoppers move 
into adjacent tomato fields.
The beet leafhopper (Circulifer tenellus; synonym = Neoaliturus tenellus), transmits 
Beet curly top virus to tomato. This virus is acquired and transmitted persistently 
by immature and adult stages of the beet leafhopper. Once acquired, the virus can 
be transmitted throughout adult life but is not passed to the next generation via the 
egg. The California Department of Food and Agriculture conducts yearly surveys for 
beet leafhoppers and follows an insecticide spray program to control populations of 
beet leafhoppers which helps growers manage beet curly top in processing tomato. 
Several species of leafhopper vector tomato big bud, a disease caused  
by phytoplasmas.

SYMPTOMS
Symptoms caused by viroids can be easily confused with symptoms caused by 
viruses. Similar to viruses, viroid symptom expression can be impacted by plant 
variety, age, vigor, and environmental conditions. Symptoms manifest in tomato as 
chlorosis of young terminal shoots, chlorosis which can become pronounced in the 
form of bronzing or purpling of the leaves, stunting, leaf bunchiness, leaf epinasty, 
fruit distortion and color break, and necrosis of stem and leaves, which ultimately can  
lead to plant death. Symptomology among the viroids are not distinguishable from 
one another and molecular tools are necessary to provide an accurate identification  
of a specific viroid.
CONDITIONS FOR DISEASE DEVELOPMENT
Viroids are the smallest infective agents known to cause plant disease. They consist 
of single-stranded RNA and their origins remain unknown. Viroids can infect plant 
cells and incite disease. All tomato viroids are mechanically transmissible. Viroids are 
not known to be transmitted by insects, although some insects (e.g., aphids) have 
been implicated in the spread of viroid diseases. Several ornamental plant species 
(e.g., Vinca minor, Petunia x hybrida, Cestrum spp., Verbena spp., Brugmansia spp. 
and Physalis peruviana ) have been shown to be hosts of viroids that infect tomato.
CONTROL
Breeding for resistance is often a desired trait for disease management but currently 
no sources of resistance have been identified. Potential sources of viroid inoculum 
include wild and ornamental hosts, grafted nursery plants and seed that has recently 
been implicated. Management of the disease relies on visual inspection followed by 
rogueing infected plants. The use of protective clothing and the implementation of a 
hygiene program for people, tools and structure is an excellent means to reduce the 
introduction and spread of viroids in a protected culture environment.

DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
Autogenous Necrosis: First symptoms appear when plants are six to ten weeks 
old and manifest as a yellowing of upper leaf surfaces that progresses to necrosis 
over time. Tissue necrosis tends to be more prominent on lower leaf surfaces and 
typically starts at the distal end of leaflets. As lesions coalesce, leaves become necrotic 
and die. Typically, this disorder progresses from older foliage to younger foliage.
Fruit Pox: First symptom on green fruit is small, clear or tan, oval or slightly 
elongated lesions. As fruit mature these lesions enlarge and cause the fruit epidermis 
to rupture which gives fruit a necrotic, corky appearance.
Gold Fleck: First symptom on immature green fruit is circular, dark-green spots on 
fruit surfaces. As fruit mature these spots change from dark-green to light-tan and 
then to golden yellow on ripe red fruit.
Zebra Stem: Foliar symptoms appear as small, necrotic spots along the veins of 
expanding leaflets. Later, the spots coalesce and leaflets twist and die. As stem 
lesions develop, they coalesce to form wide, brown, necrotic bands, manifesting as  
a concentric ring pattern.
Zebra Stripe: Symptoms appear as a series of dark-green spots on fruit which may 
coalesce to give fruit a green-striped appearance. Depending on variety, these stripes 
may disappear as fruit ripens.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Autogenous Necrosis: This genetic disorder is caused by an incompatible reaction 
between a gene (Cf-2 ) for resistance to Passalora fulva, causal agent of leaf mold, 
and a tissue necrosis gene that causes necrotic spots on the foliage under certain 
environmental conditions.
Fruit Pox and Gold Fleck: Although these disorders commonly occur on the same 
fruit, they are distinct and susceptibility to both is genetically inherited. Their 
development is thought to be more severe when fruit are exposed to high temperatures 
and plants and fruit are growing rapidly. However, more work is still needed to fully 
understand the cause. Tomato varieties differ greatly in their susceptibility, with some 
varieties developing only a few lesions or gold flecks, while others develop many.
Zebra Stem: This disorder is associated with tomato varieties that are homozygous 
for Pto gene, which confers resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato race 0. 
This condition is also linked to sensitivity to fenthion, an insecticide.
Zebra Stripe: Symptom expression depends on variety and temperature. High 
temperatures can trigger zebra stripe.
CONTROL
Grow varieties that are tolerant to these genetic disorders. Tomato hybrids that are 
heterozygous for Pto gene will not develop zebra stem.

SYMPTOMS
Black Shoulder: Black Shoulder is characterized by the presence of dark-grey 
to black spots, streaks, or irregularly sized lesions on the shoulders of fruit in the 
area surrounding the stem scar. Lesions may appear shriveled or sunken, indicating 
localized decay. The lesions and fungal growth are attributed to Alternaria alternata, 
an opportunistic pathogen infecting fruit tissue exposed by shoulder cracking.
Catface: Typical symptoms of this disorder are misshapen fruit with scarred areas 
and lines that often radiate from the blossom end of the fruit. Catface is often 
associated with cold temperatures during flowering. This disorder is especially 
important on large-fruited tomatoes and the severity is variety-dependent.
Chilling Injury: Symptoms include tissue browning, pitting and discoloration of skin 
and uneven ripening. Fruit susceptibility to fungal decay pathogens increases.
Cracking: Two types of cracking occur on fruit. Radial cracking is a splitting of the 
epidermis that radiates from the calyx end to the blossom end of fruit. Concentric 
cracking is a splitting of the epidermis in circular patterns around the calyx end of 
fruit. Cracking usually does not occur until fruit reach maturity.
Edema: This disorder is characterized by a blistered appearance on lower leaf 
surfaces resulting from ruptured guard cells.
Gray Wall: Also referred to as uneven ripening. Symptoms are first observed as 
flattened, blotchy, brownish-gray areas that develop on green fruit. As fruit mature 
these blotchy areas remain gray or turn yellow, resulting in uneven ripening. When 
fruit are cut open, dark-brown vascular tissue can be seen in the fruit walls.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Black Shoulder: Drastic changes in environmental conditions and mechanical 
injuries can lead to shoulder cracking. If mature green fruit with shoulder cracking 
remain in the field and are subject to cold (<10°C) temperatures, fruit rot caused 
by Alternaria alternata is likely to occur, leading to development of black shoulder 
symptoms. Although green fruit are more susceptible to shoulder cracking, both 
green and ripe fruit can develop black shoulder.
Catface: Cold (<10°C) weather during flowering and fruit set is known to enhance 
this disorder. Also, high soil nitrogen levels and any disturbance to the flower parts 
during anthesis can increase incidence of catface.
Chilling Injury: Tomatoes are highly sensitive to chilling injury when exposed to 
temperatures between -1 and 12.5°C. Both exposure time (e.g., two weeks at 10°C 
or seven days at 5°C) and fruit maturity can influence severity of damage to fruit. 
Green fruit are more susceptible to chilling injury than ripe fruit. Chilling injury can 
also occur during postharvest storage or in transit.
Catface: on immature green fruit.
Catface: on ripe red fruit.
143
Cracking: Susceptibility to cracking is related to the strength and stretching ability 
of the fruit epidermis. Periods of slow fruit growth followed by rapid growth resulting 
from large differences in day and night temperatures cause fruit cracking. Periods of 
low soil moisture followed by heavy rain or irrigation also cause this disorder.
Edema: This disorder develops when roots take up water faster than it can be used 
by the plant or transpired through the leaves. The main cause is excessively high 
moisture levels in soil or air. Edema typically occurs when the soil temperature is warm 
and the air temperature is cool. Prolonged periods of high humidity favor this disorder.
Gray Wall: Environmental factors that appear to be associated with this disorder 
include high nitrogen content of soil, low potassium content of soil, high soil moisture, 
high humidity, cool weather, low light intensity and soil compaction. In addition, 
certain bacteria and tobacco mosaic virus may play a role in occurrence and 
development of gray wall.
CONTROL
Black Shoulder: Prevent shoulder cracking of green fruit. Fresh market tomato 
varieties differ in response to black shoulder-conducive weather conditions; therefore, 
plant varieties that are less prone to shoulder cracking or that ripen evenly to reduce 
incidence of this disorder. Over-fertilization may increase the severity of black 
shoulder when environmental conditions are conducive for shoulder cracking. Avoid 
mechanical injuries to fruit.
Catface and Cracking: Grow tolerant varieties to reduce losses from these two 
disorders. Manage soil nitrogen levels and soil moisture content in field-grown 
tomatoes. In protected culture, manage day and night temperatures to reduce losses 
from catface and cracking.
Chilling Injury: In protected culture, maintain climate control systems in good 
working order. Ensure roof vents are working properly and are not a source of 
unwanted cold air. Ensure refrigeration systems in post-harvest storage facilities and 
long-haul trucks are properly maintained to minimize chilling injury.
Edema: In protected culture, reduce relative humidity by providing adequate 
ventilation and air movement. Manage ambient night temperature to prevent wide 
fluctuations and soil substrate moisture content.
Gray Wall: Grow gray wall-tolerant varieties.
Chilling Injury: browning and pitting of greenhouse-produced fruit.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Little Leaf: This disorder manifests as interveinal chlorosis in young leaves. 
Later, severity of interveinal chlorosis on newly emerging leaves will increase but 
leaf veins will remain dark-green; leaflets will be distorted. Size of newly emerged 
leaves can be greatly reduced, too. Plant stunting may occur because of reduced 
terminal growth. Plants that have mild little leaf symptoms may still set blooms and 
develop fruit, but fruit are often distorted and cracked, making them unmarketable. 
Seed development is hindered. Plants with severe little leaf symptoms often form 
misshapen blooms and do not set fruit.
Puffiness: Typically, affected fruit have an angular appearance and are less dense 
than healthy fruit. Locule development is incomplete with very few seeds and little  
gel present.
Silvering: This disorder is also known as chimera or head silvering. Leaves develop 
gray-green to silver spots or patches and the entire leaf may become silver-like in 
color. Leaves can be smaller and develop blisters and stems may develop gray-green 
streaks. Flowers may be partially or completely sterile. Fruit may have gray-green 
streaks that turn pale-yellow at maturity.
Sunscald: Sunscald occurs on the side of fruit exposed to direct sunlight. It first 
appears as a wrinkled area that can be soft and lighter in color than surrounding 
tissue. This area later collapses and becomes leathery. The affected area may turn 
black due to colonization by black mold fungi (e.g., Alternaria alternata, Pleospora 
lycopersici, Stemphylium species). Fruit near maturity are more sensitive to sunscald 
injury than immature fruit.
Yellow Shoulder: This disorder is characterized by the fruit shoulder (area adjacent 
to the stem end of fruit) not ripening completely and remaining green or yellow while 
the rest of the fruit ripens normally. Patches of the shoulder or the entire shoulder 
area may be affected. Yellow shoulder-affected areas may be associated with 
hardened, white fruit tissue.
Zippering: A thin, brown, necrotic scar that resembles a zipper will generally form 
at the stem end of a fruit and extend down the side of the fruit, sometimes all the 
way to the blossom scar. Sometimes more than one scar will develop on a fruit and 
occasionally scars do not extend to either the stem scar or blossom scar. Zipper 
severity can vary from thin to thick and from superficial to being so deep that the 
scar penetrates a fruit locule
Puffiness: incomplete locule and gel development.
Puffiness: incomplete locule and gel development.

CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Little Leaf: This disorder is associated with specific field conditions and specific soil 
microorganisms. Symptoms are often associated with warm soil, poor soil aeration 
(leading to high levels of water saturation), and pH in the neutral to alkaline range. 
Although the exact cause of this disorder is unknown, it is hypothesized that the 
condition of soil and the microorganisms that are supported in the rhizosphere play 
a role in symptom development. It is further hypothesized that the microorganisms 
in the rhizosphere of the plants produce and release compounds that are similar 
in structure to amino acids. These compounds are absorbed by the plants and the 
amino acid-like compounds trigger morphological responses and changes.
Puffiness: Factors that lead to poor seed set and gel formation are high and low 
temperature extremes, use of fruit hormones and soil moisture extremes. High soil 
nitrogen content may exacerbate development of this disorder.
Silvering: Although not well understood, silvering manifests when temperatures drop 
below 18°C. Less silvering develops in protected culture when night temperatures are 
managed well.
Sunscald: Fruit suddenly exposed to direct sunlight due to defoliation from disease, 
pruning or stem breakage are most likely to develop sunscald. Sunscald occurs when 
internal fruit temperature increases and tissue is damaged.
Yellow Shoulder: Varieties that do not ripen uniformly are more susceptible to 
environmental influences that contribute to the development of this disorder than 
varieties that ripen uniformly. If mature fruit are exposed to high temperatures or 
high levels of sunlight (due to insufficient foliar coverage), yellow shoulder symptoms 
may be more pronounced. Plants that are grown in soil with inadequate amounts of 
available potassium are also more susceptible to yellow shoulder.
Zippering: Zippering develops when the anthers attach to the ovary wall of a newly 
developing fruit. Cool temperatures and plant genetics are considered contributing 
factors for this disorder.
CONTROL
Little Leaf: Avoid fields that drain poorly, and monitor and optimize soil moisture  
to reduce incidence of little leaf. Decrease soil pH to help prevent occurrence  
of little leaf.
Puffiness: In protected culture, control temperature, humidity and soil substrate 
nutrition to reduce incidence of puffiness.
Silvering: Grow varieties that are resistant to silvering. In protected culture, avoid 
temperature-shocking plant apexes during ventilation of growing structures when 
susceptible varieties are grown.
Sunscald: Encourage abundant, healthy foliage with proper fertilization and 
irrigation. Grow disease-resistant varieties and follow an effective disease and pest 
management program to reduce losses due to sunscald. In protected culture, shade 
plants during summer, and prune and harvest plants carefully to minimize defoliation 
and fruit exposure to direct sunlight.
Yellow Shoulder: Grow varieties that ripen uniformly and manage available 
potassium levels in soil to reduce incidence of yellow shoulder.
Zippering: Grow varieties that are not prone to zippering. In protected culture, 
maintain day and night temperatures that are optimal for fruit set.
Silvering: foliage exhibiting a silver-green cast.

DISTRIBUTION

SYMPTOMS
Typically, white to yellow irregular spots develop just below the epidermis of fruit in 
response to stink bug feeding activity. These spots can be numerous if the level of 
insect feeding was high. When the fruit skin is peeled back, an area of white, glistening, 
spongy cells is apparent. When the fruit turns red, these areas remain light yellow. A 
puncture wound in the skin can generally be found in the middle of affected areas.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
When stink bugs feed on green fruit, they puncture the skin and secrete an enzyme 
that prevents development of normal color in ripening fruit. Overwintering stink bug 
adults become active in spring and fly into tomato fields from surrounding weeds. 
Edges of tomato fields nearest weedy areas are often the most affected by stink 
bugs. All growth stages of stink bug species can cause cloudy spot.

Calcium Deficiency
DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
The first visible symptom of blossom-end rot (BER) is a water-soaked area near the 
blossom scar of the fruit. This area later develops into a tan to brown, leathery, sunken 
lesion. Saprophytic fungi often colonize these lesions, which gives them a gray to 
black, velvety appearance. Sometimes an internal black rot of tissue in the center of 
fruit will develop with little or no external symptoms. Typically, immature green fruit 
that have begun sizing are first to develop symptoms of BER.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Blossom-end rot is associated with insufficient calcium uptake and alternating 
periods of wet and dry soil. Though BER is associated with mature fruit, young, 
rapidly growing fruit are most prone to calcium deficiency. Sudden and extreme 
changes in water availability may induce fruit growth fluctuations that lead to BER. 
Stress associated with root damage, mild drought, high soil salinity, or excess 
nitrogen (excess ammonium) also may cause BER. Incidence of BER may increase 
when relative humidity remains high for prolonged periods due to reduced water 
uptake by plants.
CONTROL
Grow tolerant varieties to help reduce occurrence of BER. Drip irrigate to supply an 
even amount of water and apply lime to soils low in calcium. Avoid using ammonium 
sources of fertilizer or excess magnesium since both increase demand for calcium by 
plants and reduce availability of calcium in soil. Fertilize with calcium nitrate in areas 
where BER is known to occur. Irrigate during periods of dry weather and apply mulch 
to plant beds to provide more constant soil moisture to plants. Avoid saline soils and 
fields that are difficult to irrigate uniformly. Root injury caused by mechanical damage 
during cultivation or by disease can exacerbate BER and should be avoided.

Insufficient or excessive nutrients
DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
The following symptoms are indicative of possible plant nutrient deficiencies and 
toxicities; however, soil and foliar nutrient analyses should be conducted to determine 
nutrient content and calculate nutritional requirements.
Nitrogen (N): Plants under low nitrogen stress are smaller than normal and have an 
overall light-green color, especially in the lower leaves. Fruit are small with thin walls. 
Excess nitrogen fertilizer can cause leaf and fruit burning, especially if applied as an 
ammonium formulation.
Phosphorus (P): Leaves on deficient plants are smaller than normal and dark-green. 
Older leaves are affected first and, in severe cases, may senesce. Phosphorus toxicity 
is rare but when it does occur it can interfere with copper and zinc availability.
Potassium (K): Symptoms of potassium deficiency begin on older leaves and 
progress to younger leaves. Foliage develops bronzing and/or burning of leaf margins 
and may develop chlorosis. Plants are smaller than normal and produce less fruit. Fruit 
disorders such as yellow shoulder, puffiness, gray wall, uneven ripening and internal 
whitening can result from potassium deficiency. Excess potassium is a rare condition 
but can disrupt uptake of other nutrients (e.g., Mg, Mn, Zn, Fe).
Calcium (Ca): Interveinal chlorosis and leaf margin necrosis occur at the growing 
points in calcium-deficient plants. Later, growing points die. Leaves can be distorted. 
Fruit may develop blossom-end rot. It is very uncommon to observe calcium toxicity.
Magnesium (Mg): Magnesium-deficient plants develop interveinal chlorosis on 
older leaves which later progresses to young leaves. Interveinal tissue may become 
necrotic. Magnesium toxicity is rare.
Sulfur (S): Older leaves of sulfur-deficient plants turn light-green and spindly. Excess 
sulfur can cause extensive leaf yellowing, leading to scorched leaf edges.
Boron (B): When boron is deficient, older leaves turn yellow and brittle, and growing 
points become necrotic and die. Margins and leaf tips of mature leaves become 
necrotic. Fruit may develop scattered corky areas. Excess boron can cause yellowing 
of leaf tips, then leaf necrosis, moving from leaf margins inward.
Copper (Cu): Initially young leaves of copper-deficient tomato plants wilt and later 
turn bluish-green and curl upwards. Severely affected plants are stunted and chlorotic. 
Copper toxicity manifests as leaf chlorosis and necrosis, and reduced shoot growth.
Iron (Fe): Young leaves of iron-deficient tomato plants develop interveinal chlorosis 
followed by general yellowing. Leaf midribs usually remain green. Iron toxicity 
manifests as reduced growth and interveinal chlorosis.
Manganese (Mn): Young leaves deficient in manganese develop interveinal 
chlorosis followed by necrosis. Midribs of affected leaves remain green. Manganese 
toxicity manifests as brown to black lesions on older leaves but later progresses to 
younger leaves.
Nitrogen deficiency: light-green foliage.
Nitrogen deficiency: older leaves turn chlorotic then necrotic.
153
Molybdenum (Mo): Older leaves of molybdenum-deficient tomato plants develop 
leaf yellowing and marginal necrosis that eventually progresses to younger leaves. 
Molybdenum deficiency is rare in tomato. Molybdenum toxicity is also rare and only 
occurs after accumulation from continuous applications.
Zinc (Zn): Leaves of zinc-deficient tomato plants thicken and curl downward. Petioles 
may twist and older leaves develop orange-brown chlorosis. Zinc in excess is 
extremely toxic and can cause rapid plant death.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Nutrient deficiencies are most common in acid or alkaline soils due to immobilization 
of nutrients. Low temperatures, soil compaction or excessive soil moisture may also 
affect nutrient availability. Nutrient disorders may also be caused by excessive or 
unbalanced use of fertilizer. Plant diseases that affect plant roots can induce nutrient 
deficiency symptoms due to reduced nutrient uptake.
CONTROL
Conduct soil and foliar nutrient analyses regularly to verify nutritional needs, design 
a balanced fertilizer program and correct nutrient imbalances. Alter soil pH with 
addition of lime to acid soils or sulfur and acid-forming fertilizers to alkaline soils  
to increase nutrient availability..

Herbicide Injury
Insecticide Injury
DISTRIBUTION
Worldwide
SYMPTOMS
Herbicide Injury: Contact herbicides, those that affect only tissues they contact, 
typically will cause chlorotic or necrotic spots on all parts of tomato plants. Multiple 
spots can result in deformation of affected tissues. Systemic herbicides, those that are 
translocated in tomato plants, tend to cause a variety of symptoms including stunting. 
These range from a general yellowing of foliage, to yellowing or necrosis of tissues in 
the center of the leaf, to a yellowing or necrosis of leaf veins that may expand to 
interveinal tissues. Systemic herbicides may also cause necrotic spots, leaf margin 
necrosis, twisting and upward or downward leaf cupping, as well as mild or severe 
deformation and swelling of stems and petioles. Root growth may be inhibited and 
roots may become stubby. Fruit symptoms range from development of excessively 
large or small, irregularly shaped fruit, to the development of flat or nippled blossom 
ends, or internal deformations.
2,4-D: This herbicide can cause stunting and new growth may be deformed. 
Leaves may curl or cup and take on a whip-like appearance. Leaves, petioles  
and stems may twist and become distorted.
Clomazone: This herbicide is an inhibitor of plant pigments. Leaves develop 
bleaching along leaf veins.
Glyphosate: Injury manifests as yellowing at the base of leaflets.
MCPA: This herbicide causes leaf and stem malformation. Stems may curl, twist, 
and droop whereas leaves may cup and crinkle. Fruit can also be misshapen.
Trifluralin: Lateral and secondary root development is limited. Roots that do form 
tend to be short and stubby.
Insecticide Injury: Insecticides typically cause leaf margin necrosis or necrotic 
lesions on foliage.
Acephate: Applications during high temperatures may cause curling and 
interveinal necrosis, especially on the distal end of leaflets.
Oxamyl: Foliar applications of this nematicide can cause leaf burn if Oxamyl is not 
rinsed well enough from the foliage.
Pylon: “Bleached” leaf spots and leaf burn may develop if this insecticide is applied 
when ambient temperature is high.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Pesticides labeled for use on tomato generally do not cause damage unless they are 
applied at excessive rates, at high temperatures, at the wrong stage of plant growth 
or during unfavorable weather conditions. Some pre-plant herbicides may remain 
active in the soil long enough to cause injury later when seed is sown or seedlings 
are transplanted. Damage may occur from herbicide drift when adjacent crops or 
weeds are sprayed. Usually damage from drift is most severe at the edge of the 
field closest to the pesticide application. Damage from pesticides may occur if spray 
equipment is not rinsed thoroughly after each pesticide application.
CONTROL
Use herbicides and insecticides as directed by the label and apply during appropriate 
weather conditions only. Store herbicides and insecticides according to label 
recommendations.

SYMPTOMS
Blind plants have been reported in several crops including beets, brassicas, eggplants 
and peppers. This disorder is characterized by loss of apical meristem function in 
seedlings. Affected plants exhibit stunted growth, do not form flower buds and the few 
leaves that form are thick and distorted. Stems may proliferate from below the apex.
CONDITIONS FOR SYMPTOM DEVELOPMENT
Blind seedlings as young as 12 days old have been observed. Several factors have been 
implicated with this disorder: fluctuating temperatures, low light and poor nutrition. 
Supplements of nitrogen and phosphorous were shown to alleviate this disorder but 
further studies are needed. Some tomato-growing regions (Florida, USA) have seen an 
increase in expression of this disorder during fall tomato production months.
CONTROL
Random occurrence and lack of evidence for what triggers this disorder makes it 
difficult to implement control measures. Supplements of nitrogen and phosphorous were 
shown to alleviate this disorder but further studies are needed. Avoid excessive irrigation 
to prevent nutrients from being leached from the root zone to cause nutrient stress.

NEMATICIDE A substance that kills or inhibits nematodes.
NEMATODE Tiny worms that can live in plants, animals, soil or water.
NON-PERSISTENT TRANSMISSION Type of insect transmission 
of a plant virus in which the virus is acquired by the insect vector 
after a very short acquisition feeding time and is transmitted to 
plants during a short transmission feeding time by the insect.
NYMPH Juvenile stage of an insect. 
PASTEURIZATION The process of partial sterilization by heating  
at controlled temperatures to kill undesirable microorganisms.
PATHOGEN An organism or agent that can cause disease.
PEDICEL The stalk of a flower or fruit.
PERCOLATION Liquid passing through small pores.
PERSISTENT TRANSMISSION Type of insect transmission of a plant 
virus in which the virus is acquired by the insect vector after a long 
acquisition feeding time and is transmitted to plants after a long 
latent period in which the virus replicates and circulates through the 
digestive system of the insect vector and into the salivary glands. 
The insect vector generally remains infectious for the duration of 
its adult life.
PESTICIDE Any chemical or physical agent which destroys, prevents, 
mitigates or repels or attracts pests.
PETIOLE The stalk of a leaf.
PHLOEM The food conducting tissue of a plant.
PHYTOPLASMA A pleomorphic, obligate, single-celled organism 
that lacks a cell wall. Formerly referred to as a mycoplasma-like 
organism (MLO).
PHYTOTOXIC Poisonous, injurious or lethal to plants. Usually  
describing a chemical.
PITH Soft, spongy tissue in the center of a plant stem.
PLANT NURSERY A place where plants are grown for the sake  
of being moved or transplanted later.
PLASMID Circular piece of double stranded DNA found in certain 
bacteria and fungi that carries nonessential genetic information 
and is self-replicating.
POLLEN Fine powdery substance, typically yellow, consisting  
of one-celled microspores in a seed plant.

GLOSSARY
PROTECTED CULTURE A vegetable production system that includes 
structures such as greenhouses, high tunnels and mini tunnels.
PUSTULE A small blister-like elevation of the epidermis that forms 
as fungal spores develop and emerge from plant tissue.
PYCNIDIUM (pl. pycnidia) A spherical or flask-shaped asexual 
fruiting structure that gives rise to fungal conidia.
RACE A subspecific group of pathogens with distinct pathological  
or physiological properties.
RESERVOIR Plants that are infected with a disease-causing organism 
and can serve as a source for further infection of other plants.
RESISTANCE (adj. resistant) The ability of a plant variety to restrict 
the activities of a specific pathogen or insect pest and/or to restrict 
the symptoms and signs of a disease, when compared to susceptible 
varieties. Varieties with resistance may exhibit some symptoms 
when specified pathogen or pest pressure is severe. New and/or 
atypical strains of the specific pathogen or pest may overcome  
the resistance.
RNA Ribonucleic acid; a molecule, found in the cells of all living 
things and in some viruses, that helps make proteins.
ROOTSTOCK Portion of stem and associated root system onto 
which a bud or scion is inserted by grafting.
SAPROPHYTE (adj. saprophytic) An organism that lives on dead 
organic matter.
SATURATION Being filled with liquid, generally water.
SCION A bud or shoot inserted by grafting.
SCLEROTIUM (pl. sclerotia) A compact mass of hyphae capable  
of surviving unfavorable environmental conditions.
SEED TRANSMISSION Movement of inoculum from an infected 
seed to a plant.
SEEDBORNE DISEASE Inoculum is carried on or within the seed.
SEMI-PERSISTENT TRANSMISSION Type of insect transmission of 
a plant virus in which the vector acquisition feeding time is short with 
no latent period, no virus replication occurs in the vector and the 
virus can be transmitted by the vector for no more than a few days.
SENESCE Growing old; aging.
SEPAL Modified leaf-like structure that is a unit of the calyx.
SOILBORNE DISEASE Inoculum is carried on or under the soil surface.
SOLANACEAE The nightshade family which includes tobacco, 
tomato, potato, pepper, eggplant, tomatillo and others.
SOLARIZATION Exposure to direct sunlight to raise soil temperatures 
to levels that kill pathogens.
SPORE A reproductive structure of fungi and some bacteria.
SPORULATE To form or produce spores.
STOMA (pl. stomata) A tiny pore in a plant leaf surrounded by a  
pair of guard cells that regulate its opening and closure, and 
serves as the site for gas exchange.
STRAIN A general term referring to (a) an isolate; descendent of 
a pure culture of pathogen, (b) a race; one of a group of similar 
isolates or (c) one of a group of virus isolates that have common 
antigens.

SUSCEPTIBILITY (adj. susceptible) The inability of plants to 
restrict the activities of a specified pest or pathogen.
SYSTEMIC Spreading internally throughout a plant.
TELEOMORPH The sexual form of a fungus.
Ti PLASMID Tumor-inducing plasmid used to transfer genetic 
material from the plasmid to plant cells.
TOLERANCE (adj. tolerant) The ability of plants to endure a  
specified pest, pathogen, environmental pressure or chemical
